## The world in brief 2023-05-28

Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of <strong>America’s </strong>House of Representatives, said his negotiators were “closer to an agreement” with the Biden administration on a deal to raise the <strong>debt ceiling</strong>. That echoed the president’s claim a day earlier that a deal was “very close”. Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, said the government would run out of money by June 5th unless the[ borrowing limit is raised](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/22/what-happens-if-america-defaults-on-its-debt).

Oleksiy Danilov, a member of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s war cabinet, told the BBC that <strong>Ukraine</strong> was ready to launch its counter-offensive. On Friday Ukraine said it had shot down ten Russian missiles and more than 20 [drones](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/08/how-ukrainians-modify-civilian-drones-for-military-use) launched overnight. At least two people were killed and 30 injured in Dnipro after a missile hit a hospital. In Kharkiv a fire reportedly broke out in an oil depot after it was struck twice.

Ken Paxton, <strong>Texas’s</strong> Republican attorney-general, was <strong>impeached</strong> by lawmakers in the state’s lower chamber over allegations of abuse of office. He will be temporarily removed from the job while the state Senate votes to oust him permanently, which would represent a rare punishment. [Mr Paxton](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/04/16/ken-paxtons-bid-for-re-election-is-a-test-of-texas-republicans-values) called the move “profoundly unjust”. He stands accused of using his office to help a donor, then obstructing investigators.

The governor of Pskov, a <strong>Russian </strong>region, said a strike by two drones had damaged an oil-pipeline building near the border with <strong>Belarus</strong>. Meanwhile, Russia dismissed America’s criticism of its plan to move nuclear weapons to Belarus—the first deployment outside its borders since 1991. Russia’s embassy in America said Belarus and Russia had a “sovereign right” to ensure their security.

<strong>Serbia’s </strong>president, Aleksandar Vucic, said he would step down as leader of his party but remain as president. His government has faced multiple crises in recent weeks. On Friday Mr Vucic ordered army units towards the [border of Kosovo](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/20/kosovo-and-serbia-are-on-the-verge-of-conflict-again), after a group of ethnic Serbs clashed with police there. He has also faced widespread protests after two mass shootings in Serbia.

<strong>Iran </strong>exchanged fire with the <strong>Taliban </strong>on the Afghan border, exacerbating a conflict over water rights. This month Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s president, warned Afghanistan not to restrict his country’s rights to the Helmand river, which flows into Lake Hamun, on the border. Its water is a vital resource: Iran’s meteorological agency says 97% of the country faces some level of drought.

The <strong>Cannes Film Festival’s</strong> top prize went to “Anatomy of a Fall”, a French courtroom drama directed by Justine Triet about a woman suspected of murdering her husband. It was only the third film directed by a woman to win the Palme d’Or. Jonathan Glazer’s movie about an Auschwitz commandant, “The Zone of Interest”, took the second-place award.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>Shukatsu, </em>or “death planning” in Japanese, a term that combines the words “end” and “activity” and is often used in relation to funeral planning.

## Erdogan is favourite to win in Turkey’s election run-off

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, enters the second round of the presidential election on Sunday as the favourite. He won 49.5% of the vote in the first round on May 14th. His opponent in the run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, [won](https://secim.ntv.com.tr/) 44.9%. Mr Erdogan, who has become increasingly authoritarian during his 20 years in power, also scored a resounding victory in the parliamentary elections. His coalition [took](http://secim.ntv.com.tr/) 323 out of the 600 seats. 

Mr Kilicdaroglu, who has promised to make Turkey more democratic, tried to make up ground by pandering to the far right, notably by pledging to send millions of refugees in Turkey back home. But this was not enough to earn him the backing of Sinan Ogan<strong>,</strong> the nationalist candidate, who won 5.2% in the first round. He endorsed Mr Erdogan. Mr Kilicdaroglu has been backed by Umit Ozdag, head of the xenophobic Victory Party. But recent polls suggest that Mr Kilicdaroglu lags behind Mr Erdogan. There is not much time to change that.

## A controversial new parliament building opens in India

On Sunday Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, will open a new parliament building in Delhi. According to his government, the new construction is much needed as the existing complex, built in 1927 during the colonial era, shows “signs of distress and over-utilisation”. 

Opposition parties, however, say the construction is merely a vanity project; nineteen have announced they will boycott the opening ceremony. They have taken umbrage that Mr Modi will be doing the inaugurating instead of President Droupadi Murmu, who outranks Mr Modi in the country’s constitution. 

It is the latest strain in a deteriorating relationship between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition. Such disagreements are rendering parliamentary government ineffective: sessions are often interrupted by protests; important legislation is passed without discussion. The lower house is on track to sit for just 331 days during the current government’s five-year term which ends in 2024, the lowest figure since 1952. It may take more than a new building to fix India’s democracy.

## The end of “Succession”

After four seasons of scatological insults and sociopathy, back-stabbing and joyless luxury, Jesse Armstrong’s critically acclaimed “Succession” ends on Sunday. Audiences have watched enthralled as the children of Logan Roy schemed to become the media tycoon’s successor.

The show’s ratings on Max, HBO’s streaming service, have reached all-time highs this season; episodes were on average watched by a record 8.4m viewers.The witty scripts have garnered Mr Armstrong five Emmy Awards. The actors have racked up three Golden Globes between them. 

Although it was clearly anticipated in the show’s title, fans were still left reeling after the family’s patriarch, played by Brian Cox, died early in the final season. Killing off the kingpin was risky. But Mr Armstrong deftly tilted the story to focus on Mr Roy’s miserable offspring. The final episode will answer the titular question: who will take Mr Roy’s throne? And you never know, <em>The Economist</em> might get another mention.

## The Indian Premier League just gets bigger

The 16th season of the Indian Premier League culminates on Sunday when the Chennai Super Kings face the Gujarat Titans in the final. This season has already broken many records: the group stage featured the most centuries (100-plus runs scored by a batsman) and sixes (cricket’s equivalent to a home run) ever. The heavy hitting has attracted a record audience. According to one estimate, nearly 500m people tuned in to live broadcasts of the first 66 matches shown on the Disney Star Network, the league’s television broadcaster. JioCinema, the official streaming platform, had 25m viewers for a playoff match. 

The IPL’s success has prompted other countries to launch similar cricket leagues. Now it is influencing global cricket more directly. Owners of IPL teams have snapped up teams abroad, including sides in Major League Cricket, a new American competition that begins in July. In a sign of things to come, Jason Roy, England’s aggressive opening batter, signed for MLC on Thursday.

## Weekend profile: Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s incoming president

When Bola Tinubu is inaugurated as [Nigeria’s president](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/01/bola-tinubu-nigerias-political-kingmaker-wins-a-flawed-election) on Monday, he will move into the official residence. Among his baggage will be plenty of the political and legal sort. The wealthy 71-year-old styles himself as the “Godfather of Lagos”, Nigeria’s sprawling commercial capital, where he was governor for eight years until 2007. His backers say that he cleaned up the city, increased the tax take nearly six-fold and built infrastructure. 

Yet his record invites questions. His rivals are still disputing his election win in court and claim it was rigged. Some Nigerians suspect that he pulled strings in dubious ways in the past to help his predecessor as president, Muhammadu Buhari, get elected. Back in 2019, when Mr Buhari was running for a second term, onlookers spotted two armoured vehicles, similar to those used by banks to transport cash, driving into Mr Tinubu’s compound in Lagos. He dismissed any suggestion that he had bought votes. “If I have money…I give it to the people free of charge, as long as [it’s] not to buy votes,” Mr Tinubu explained, less than reassuringly.

Some wonder where his money comes from. His explanations have varied from inheritance and real estate to a large bonus earned while working as an auditor at Deloitte, an accounting firm. In the 1990s the American government froze his assets over his alleged links to the heroin trade. Mr Tinubu denied wrongdoing and reached a settlement with the Americans whereby he forfeited $460,000.

Others question how he so impressively increased Lagos’s tax take. Last year he settled a lawsuit accusing him of secretly owning most of a firm that had won a contract to collect taxes on behalf of Lagos state during his governorship. Court papers alleged that it earned a commission of 10% on all revenues collected there. Mr Tinubu again denied wrongdoing. 

Mr Tinubu now faces one of the world’s toughest in-trays. Many Nigerians also question whether he has the energy—and health—to tackle it. He is often abroad for medical trips, including a recent stay in Paris. As the presidential race last year heated up Mr Tinubu had been absent from the public eye for so long that he released a video on Twitter of himself pedalling an exercise bike. “Many have said I have died”, he posted. “Well…Nope”.
