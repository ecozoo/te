A <strong>Russian</strong> “air bomb” hit a blood-transfusion centre in north-eastern <strong>Ukraine</strong>, according to Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine’s president called the attack a “war crime”. The strike came after a two-day [Ukraine-war](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/03/why-ukraine-may-be-choosing-a-war-of-attrition) peace conference began in Saudi Arabia. Officials from 40 countries—but not <strong>Russia</strong>—attended the summit, including delegates from Asian and African countries that have remained neutral in the conflict. 

## Will there be a military intervention in Niger?

Sunday marks the deadline set by ECOWAS, a group of west African countries, for the junta that [ousted Niger’s president](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/28/nigers-putsch-is-bad-for-the-country-and-for-the-region), Mohamed Bazoum, to reinstate him. Otherwise, ECOWAS’s members may send in their armed forces. The bloc’s defence chiefs have met to plan the operation: Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Benin have promised to contribute. The junta says that any intervention will result in “an immediate and unannounced response” by its army aimed at one of the bloc’s unfriendly member countries. The military officers who lead Burkina Faso and Mali, Niger’s [jihadist-plagued neighbours](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/01/fanatics-and-putschists-are-creating-failed-states-in-west-africa), say they will consider any intervention by ECOWAS in Niger to be a declaration of war on them, too. 

On Friday it emerged that an ECOWAS mediation team left [Niger](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/01/why-the-nightmare-in-niger-is-the-worlds-problem) without meeting either Mr Bazoum or General Abdourahamane Tchiani, the junta’s leader. Any intervention will almost certainly not start by the deadline. Instead the bloc will ratchet up pressure, perhaps by beginning to pre-position troops. Each side will be hoping that the other backs down—or suggests a face-saving fudge.

## The surprising resilience of the “non-AI” economy

Investors are understandably euphoric about artificial intelligence. Earnings in the S&amp;P 500 in the second quarter of this year are set to slide by 5.2% year on year, the biggest decline since the pandemic, according to FactSet, a data provider. By contrast, [big tech](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/02/can-big-tech-keep-getting-bigger-in-the-age-of-ai) is raking in the cash. Between January and June, [Alphabet](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/30/is-there-more-to-alphabet-than-google-search), Meta and Microsoft, three AI-heavyweights, collectively posted operating profits of $106bn, up by $9bn from the same period last year.

Yet the rest of the economy should not be forgotten. Several industries that have nothing to do with AI are booming. On August 1st Starbucks, a coffee retailer, added $1.1bn in profits for this quarter, a rise of 25% year on year. The next day Kraft Heinz, a consumer-goods firm, posted a year-on-year boost of 13% to its core business. Food businesses have aggressively raised their prices; other industries, such as travel, have benefited from healthy pandemic-related savings in American households. Shiny new tech is not the only route to success.

## Taylor Swift, money-maker

After 53 shows in 20 cities, the American part of [Taylor Swift’s](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/25/can-superstars-like-beyonce-or-taylor-swift-spur-inflation) “Eras Tour” will conclude next week in Los Angeles. In her three-hour-long set she sings more than 40 songs from her ten albums. Alongside the tour she has released a re-recorded version of her third album, “Speak Now”. Ms Swift recently became the first woman to have four albums on Billboard’s top-ten list at the same time. 

The Eras Tour shows the American star’s [business acumen](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/01/if-ticketmaster-is-a-greedy-capitalist-so-is-taylor-swift) as well as her hitmaking talent. Fans spent some $600m for tickets, which cost up to $899 apiece, on the American leg. Analysts think that the tour, which will present 146 shows once the international portion is completed next year, could be the first ever to gross $1bn. That could help make Ms Swift the first female billionaire musician in history.

## Australian ballet leaps

The Australian Ballet company has been celebrating its 60th anniversary with a year-long extravaganza of pirouettes and pliés. This week the troupe arrived in London, the first international trip it has undertaken since the pandemic began. For this diamond jubilee, the Royal Opera House has hosted five performances of “Jewels”, [George Balanchine’s](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/03/the-life-and-times-of-george-balanchine) three-act ballet inspired by different gems, styles of dance and composers. David Hallberg, the company’s artistic director, has said that the work demands “technical virtuosity” from dancers and offers the audience a “visual feast”. 

Sunday marks the grand finale of the birthday bash. A gala performance will feature a wide range of works, including Marius Petipa’s “Harequinade” (which had its premiere in 1900), Rudolf Nureyev’s version of “Don Quixote” (performed by the Australian Ballet in 1970) and contemporary works by choreographers such as Justin Peck, a Tony-award winner. It will be a show for traditionalists and modernists alike.

## Weekend profile: Jack Smith, the prosecutor pursuing Donald Trump

The president, prosecutors alleged, had persecuted his opponents and sought to thwart the investigation. This transpired in 2020 a world away from Washington, DC: the accused was [Hashim Thaci](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/06/27/kosovos-president-hashim-thaci-faces-war-crimes-charges), Kosovo’s former president (and in his case the charges included murder). But the impassive, grizzled figure levying the charges was the same prosecutor who [indicted Donald Trump](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-indicted-for-trying-to-steal-the-2020-election) on Tuesday. No man is above the law, said Jack Smith, when he charged Mr Thaci. Not the leader of a tiny Balkan country then, nor the former leader of the free world now.

In November America’s attorney-general named Mr Smith a special counsel—a quasi-independent prosecutor—in charge of the multiple federal inquiries into Mr Trump. At the time, he was in The Hague, investigating crimes committed during the Kosovo war of 1998-99. Since becoming the top cop on the Trump beat, Mr Smith has indicted the former president twice, for [mishandling classified documents](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/09/donald-trump-is-in-his-most-serious-legal-trouble-yet) and for [conspiring to steal the 2020 election](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-accused-of-democracys-gravest-political-crime). 

Mr Smith, aged 54, has been trying to nail crooks since graduating from Harvard Law School. First came a 14-year stint as a prosecutor in New York, where he would sometimes cycle to crime scenes. He won convictions in grisly, headline-grabbing cases: the shooting of two undercover detectives on Staten Island, the beating of a defenceless man by a cop in Brooklyn. Once, after he won a conviction in a murder trial, a besotted juror called out: “Will you be my lawyer?”

Between 2010 and 2015 Mr Smith helmed a division of the federal justice department investigating corruption by government officials. The “public-integrity” unit was in a funk when he arrived: its conviction of a senator had just been thrown out owing to prosecutors’ own misconduct. A year into his tenure convictions rose nearly sevenfold.

Mr Smith once told an interviewer that he aims to serve law-abiding folk who “pay their taxes, follow the rules and…expect their public officials to do the same”. Indeed former colleagues describe Mr Smith, an accomplished triathlete, as a stickler, both in his morals and in his methods. That makes him a perfect foil to the biggest target of his career. As Mr Trump would say, he is straight out of central casting.
