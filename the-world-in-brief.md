<strong>Israel </strong>continued to launch air strikes across the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong>. Bombs reportedly hit the Jabalia refugee camp in the north, as well as the [southern cities](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/26/a-brutal-battle-for-southern-gaza-beckons-after-the-truce-ends) of Khan Younis and Rafah. Israeli ground troops also clashed with Hamas near Khan Younis, suggesting that a planned ground offensive in Gaza’s south had begun. The White House urged Israel to do more to protect civilians and said it was trying to persuade Hamas and Israel to resume negotiations. Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said the death toll in the enclave since October 7th had exceeded 15,500.

## A hearing for Duterte

Rodrigo Duterte, a former president of the Philippines, is due to appear before prosecutors in Manila on Monday. Mr Duterte has been summoned to answer a criminal complaint that he threatened to kill a member of congress, France Castro, an opponent of his political dynasty, on live television. Mr Duterte’s response so far has been cryptic, saying that Ms Castro is “oppressing” him. 

Ms Castro’s complaint is grave. But it pales in comparison with suspicions that, when Mr Duterte was president, his law enforcers avidly carried out general death threats he made against dealers in illegal drugs, [killing thousands of people](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/22/how-many-people-have-been-killed-in-rodrigo-dutertes-war-on-drugs). Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, suspecting crimes against humanity, are investigating some of those killings. But Mr Duterte’s successor and protector, President Ferdinand Marcos, is shunning their investigation. He calls it redundant because the Philippines has a functioning system of justice of its own. Ms Castro’s case will test Mr Marcos’s argument. The outcome will show whether the system functions to uphold justice, or impunity. 

## A Senate battle over Ukraine aid

America’s Senate this week formally takes up President Joe Biden’s $106bn supplemental request for national security, including military aid to Ukraine. As the flow of American weapons to Ukraine [slows down](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/12/02/americas-political-paralysis-is-complicating-its-support-for-ukraine), nobody is certain whether congressional paralysis can be overcome soon, or at all.

Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, has urged Congress not to waver at a “hinge in history” as foes—including Russia, China and Iran—seek to weaken American leadership. But the aid faces many obstacles. One is a demand by Republicans to pair it with asylum reform and other steps to stanch migration at the southern border. Another is some Democrats’ call to put conditions on aid to Israel to limit civilian casualties in Gaza. A third is a push by China hawks to increase help to Taiwan, funded by squeezing economic assistance to Ukraine. And even if the Senate strikes a deal, it is uncertain whether bitterly divided Republicans in the House would agree to it. 

## Turkey’s sticky inflation

After Recep Tayyip Erdogan won re-election in this year’s Turkish presidential elections, he [appointed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/04/turkeys-president-erdogan-shifts-towards-sane-economics) a new finance minister and central bank governor. They pulled off the policy U-turn the country’s economy needed. Faced with runaway inflation and the prospect of a currency crash, Turkey’s central bank has raised the benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 31.5 percentage points in only five months, to 40%. Currency depreciation, which saw the Turkish lira lose nearly 30% of its dollar value in the first six months of the year, has slowed. 

But inflation, stoked by years of lending at negative real rates, has proved exceptionally sticky. On Monday Turkey publishes its inflation data for November. Economists polled by Reuters expect consumer prices to have risen by 63% in annual terms, up from 61.4% in October. The central bank’s own forecast puts the annual inflation rate at 65% by the end of the year. The bank will need to keep tightening to see any improvement.

## Polish and Ukrainian lorry drivers stand off

Snow-dusted lines of lorries snake for dozens of kilometres at the border between Poland and Ukraine. Since November 6th Polish drivers have enforced a blockade, letting only a few Ukrainian vehicles through every hour (humanitarian supplies are allowed passage). The queues at four crossings amount to 3,000 lorries. Ukraine is preparing to evacuate hundreds of drivers. On Monday Polish ministers will voice the woes of the protesters at the EU’s Transport Council meeting in Brussels.

The Polish drivers criticise [the EU](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/30/poland-is-being-given-an-opportunity-to-matter-in-europe) for abolishing an entry permit system after Russia’s invasion. They say that unfairly favours their cheaper Ukrainian rivals whose transport companies are exempt from the bloc’s climate regulations. [Poland](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/21/why-poland-is-halting-its-supply-of-weapons-to-ukraine) argues that Ukraine’s electronic queuing system discriminates against foreign drivers trying to leave, holding them up further. The EU is getting impatient: on November 29th it accused Poland of holding it “hostage” by blocking its external borders. Yet Slovak and Hungarian drivers are threatening similar blockades.

## A refresh at the Met

Museums are not just about what you see, but how. After a five-year renovation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York presents a fresh take on a core part of its collection. The initiative, called “Look Again: European Paintings 1300–1800”, has seen 45 galleries repainted, relit and rehung. Recent acquisitions and loans notably boost the representation of female artists. But the project mainly shows old works in a new light—indeed, the impetus for the reshuffle was the replacement of the galleries’ skylights.

The biggest change is that works are organised chronologically rather than by country. Italian panel paintings now hang next to their Dutch equivalents, Americans portraits alongside British. Sculpture, decorative art and even musical instruments are sprinkled throughout. As is modern art: in one gallery, the work of Gerrit Dou, a 17th-century Dutch artist, rubs elbows with that of Henri Matisse, Elaine De Kooning and Kerry James Marshall, a contemporary painter. Artwork and visitors alike are invited into new conversations.
