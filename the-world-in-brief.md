<strong>Taiwan’s</strong> strongest <strong>earthquake</strong> in 25 years struck the east of the island. The 7.4-magnitude quake’s epicentre was in the sea about 18km (11 miles) south of the city of Hualien. Tsunami warnings were raised in Japan and the Philippines but later dropped. Buildings have collapsed and the power supply was disrupted in the capital, Taipei. TSMC, Taiwan’s chipmaking giant, evacuated several of its factories. Details of casualties remain scant; early reports suggest that at least seven people have died and hundreds have been injured.

## Texas’s contentious new immigration law

On Wednesday the Fifth Circuit, America’s [most conservative](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/30/a-maga-court-in-new-orleans-is-shaping-the-supreme-courts-agenda) federal appeals court, will hear oral arguments on Texas’s new immigration law. [Senate Bill 4 (SB4)](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/03/21/will-texas-succeed-in-enforcing-its-own-immigration-law) makes crossing into Texas from Mexico except at legal ports of entry a state crime. It grants police the authority to arrest people they suspect have come into Texas illegally, and authorises state judges to order deportations, powers normally reserved for federal authorities. On March 19th the Supreme Court ruled that Texas could temporarily enforce the bill while the lower court deliberated on its merits. But the Fifth Circuit put it back on hold that night. 

The debate is part of a clash between the Biden administration and Greg Abbott, Texas’s governor, over how to handle the influx of migrants. The federal government reckons that it reserves the right to set immigration policy, while Texas contends it ought to be able to defend itself. One way or another, the case will probably return to the Supreme Court.

## More ammunition for Ukraine

Jan Lipavsky, the Czech foreign minister, deserves the gratitude of his NATO counterparts at their meeting on Wednesday. Mr Lipavsky has led his government’s initiative to source shells for Ukraine. They are badly needed: for the past few months [Russia has been outgunning](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/03/20/might-russia-run-out-of-big-guns) Ukraine at a rate of at least five to one. 

Although the first tranche of 800,000 shells may not reach Ukraine until June, simply knowing that they are coming has eased the pressure on Ukrainian commanders to ration munitions. The Czechs think they can find up to 1.5m shells in total. Other NATO members, including Norway, Germany and Canada, have footed the bill.

However, the initiative is no substitute for the Biden administration’s $61bn military support package, still stalled in Congress. Apart from shells, Ukraine needs more air-defence interceptors as it reels from a new onslaught of Russian missiles, as well as the Kremlin’s powerful glide bombs. Only American support will help procure them<strong>. </strong>

## Disney’s proxy fight reaches a climax

Bob Iger’s re-run as boss of Disney has been far from the fairytale many hoped for. The entertainment giant’s share price is up by 25% since Mr Iger returned in November 2022, a better performance than that of its rivals’, including Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global. But Mr Iger continues to [tussle](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/09/the-bob-iger-v-nelson-peltz-rematch) with activist shareholders. They think Disney should be doing better still (it has been outpaced by the S&amp;P 500 index of big American companies).

On Wednesday the saga will reach a climax. At the company’s annual general meeting shareholders will vote on whether to accept board nominees put forward by two activist firms: Trian Partners, led by Nelson Peltz, a Wall Street veteran, and Blackwells Capital. Trian wants deeper cost cutting, among other things. Blackwells thinks shareholders could be better off if the company were broken up. If either gets a seat at the table, Disney’s next season could be even more dramatic.

## An imminent rate cut for Europe

Next Thursday the [European Central Bank](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/26/europes-economy-is-under-attack-from-all-sides) may start to cut interest rates. Euro-area figures for March, published on Wednesday, will show that inflation is approaching the bank’s target of 2%. The economics suggest that the ECB should start cutting long before inflation hits that target.

Germany, France, Italy and Spain have already reported their national inflation rates for March. Their numbers—2.3%, 2.4%, 1.3% and 3.2% respectively—suggest that 2% is close. There are two reasons for the ECB to hurry. Fiscal policy can only get tighter: France is trying to trim its bombshell budget deficit, and Germany is expected to limit its spending to a constitutionally allowed size. That will weaken the economy further. Second, the gap between the ECB’s current interest rate (4%) and the possible target rate (2%) is large. Reaching it will require more 0.25 percentage-point cuts than the ECB has meetings left this year. Time for the bank to look forward.

## Could medical devices be oxygen-powered?

The medical-technology industry is among the most innovative. But many electric medical devices are still powered by lithium batteries, which must eventually be replaced. Chinese engineers reporting in <em>Chem</em>, a journal, may have breathed new life into medtech by drawing power from the body itself. They have developed an implantable battery that runs on blood oxygen.

The battery’s electrodes—made of sodium and gold—react with oxygen molecules to produce electricity. Engineers surgically implanted the batteries in rats’ backs and measured the electrical output. The 1.3 volts produced was not enough to power a medical device like a pacemaker, but metal-O2 batteries can in theory store more energy than lithium ones. The experiment also had unintended benefits. By reading the battery’s output, the scientists were able to monitor the rate at which the wound healed. And because the battery consumes oxygen, implanting it near tumours could starve cancer cells. Not a bad set of side-effects.
