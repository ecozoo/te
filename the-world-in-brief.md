To no one’s surprise <strong>Russia’s</strong> election commission said that early results from the country’s [sham presidential election](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/03/17/vladimir-putins-sham-re-election-is-notable-only-for-the-protests) showed Vladimir Putin winning 87% of the vote, allowing him another six-year term. Long queues formed at some polling stations at noon on Sunday. That was the hour at which supporters of Alexei Navalny—Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, who died in prison last month—had called on people to turn up by way of protest. 

## China’s opaque economy

The strength of China’s [economic recovery](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/03/14/chinas-economic-bright-spots-provide-a-warning) is becoming harder to judge. That represents a kind of progress compared with much of last year, when the economy was all too clearly weak. More recent indicators have been mixed. Exports and inflation were surprisingly strong in February. Credit growth and house prices, on the other hand, were disappointing.

On Monday China released further clues in the form of data on domestic economic activity in the first two months of this year (often combined in China’s statistics because the Spring Festival holiday can fall in either). Retail sales grew year-on-year by 5.5% (before adjusting for inflation), down from December’s figure. But industrial production grew by 7%, its fastest pace for almost two years. Extra working days may have helped. The leap year is yet another reason why China’s economic momentum is even harder to decipher than usual.

## Why Ukraine is running out of shells

The worsening situation in Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda when foreign ministers from the European Union meet on Monday. Ukrainian forces have been suffering acute “shell hunger” since the end of last year. This, combined with exhaustion and sagging morale, was a major reason for their withdrawal from Avdiivka, a strategically important [eastern town](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/02/17/avdiivka-falls-at-last-as-russia-presses-along-the-front-line), a month ago. 

Both America and Europe bear the blame for the shortages. MAGA Republicans have stalled a \$60bn military-support bill for months; the EU has provided Ukraine with less than half the 1m shells it had promised to supply by March. (That deadline has now been stretched to the end of the year.) The European Commission has recently allocated €500m (around $550m) to boost Europe’s shell production, but will not hit its target of 2m a year until the end of 2025. A Czech initiative to source 800,000 shells may be more immediately promising. In the meantime Russia is pressing home its advantage.

## Alleged social-media meddling at SCOTUS

America’s Supreme Court will hear <em>Murthy v Missouri</em> on Monday. The case contends that the Biden administration pressured social-media companies to engage in censorship—and, in doing so, violated the principle of [free speech](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/02/23/two-ideas-of-free-speech-duel-at-americas-supreme-court) enshrined in the First Amendment.

Louisiana, Missouri and five individuals complain that federal officials cajoled platforms to remove posts related to the covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election. The plaintiffs argue that the government tried to “coerce private companies to censor ordinary Americans”. They cite examples such as the White House telling Twitter to “get moving” in taking down an anti-vaccine tweet by Robert F. Kennedy in January 2021, or asking Facebook “are you guys fucking serious?” and badgering the company about censoring misinformation that July.

The Biden administration counters that presidents “have long used the bully pulpit to shape private conduct and influence the public on the issues of the day”. It argues that only “threats or inducements”, not “strong language”, count as illicit coercion.

## Europe’s economy picks up

On Monday the European Union’s statistics agency will release figures for international trade in goods in January, as well as inflation data for February. Both are likely to provide much-needed good news. In December 2023 the euro area reported a €16.8bn ($18.3bn) surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world, reflecting strengthening exports; a year earlier it had reported a deficit of €8.5bn. Inflation, meanwhile, is on a downward trend. The annual rate was 2.8% in January 2024, compared with 8.6% in January 2023. 

Europe’s economic performance pales in comparison to [America](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/03/14/americas-extraordinary-economy-keeps-defying-the-pessimists), where the economy has grown twice as fast as the euro zone’s since the end of 2019. That is partly because of European problems with red tape, high energy costs and a shortage of skilled labour. But Europe still has reasons to be cheerful: it remains an export champion, and its fiscal deficits are far smaller than the one across the pond. 

## Modernism, out of whole cloth

Modernism is criss-crossed with grids—in fact, they define [modernist](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/01/ukraines-modernist-art-has-defied-censorship-and-missiles) movements like cubism and De Stijl (a Dutch style built on vertical and horizontal lines). Curves suggest old, natural forms. Grids signal something new.

“Woven Histories: Textiles and Modern Abstraction”, an exhibition which opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC at the weekend, locates the grid’s origins in the warp and weft of textiles. Even ancient weavers had an affinity with abstraction: they can only draw with straight lines. “Woven Histories” highlights textiles, often by women artists, as having played key roles in the development of Dada, constructivism and the Bauhaus in the 1920s and 1930s.

In the 1960s and 1970s the rigidity of the grid yielded to rising interest in folk art and basketry. Feminist and queer artists explored the embodied politics of fashion. As modernism waned, the weave loosened. But, this show suggests, textiles still tied 20th-century art together.
