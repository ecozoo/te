## The world in brief 2023-06-03

<strong>America</strong> added 339,000 non-farm jobs in May, almost twice as many as economists had predicted. The unexpectedly strong figures reflect the country’s remarkably [resilient labour market](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/joe-biden-is-more-responsible-for-high-inflation-than-for-abundant-jobs), which has expanded for 29 months straight. However, the unemployment rate rose by more than expected, from a 53-year low of 3.4% in April, to 3.7% in May. Wage growth, a key driver of inflation, slowed to 0.3% month-on-month, but remained high at an annual rate of 4.3%.

<strong>Poland’s president</strong>, Andrzej Duda, backtracked on a [contentious law](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/30/polands-government-may-seek-to-bar-opponents-from-politics) that he approved just four days ago. The legislation created a committee to hunt Russian agents; critics—including the European Union and America—argued that it could be misused to harass the opposition. Mr Duda, allied to the ruling party, said he would propose amendments to curtail the panel’s powers to bar citizens from politics.

<strong>NATO</strong> announced that Jens Stoltenberg, its secretary-general, will meet Recep Tayyip Erdogan, [Turkey’s president](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/31/how-to-make-the-re-election-of-recep-tayyip-erdogan-less-bad-news), this weekend to discuss <strong>Sweden</strong> joining the military alliance. Turkey has delayed the expansion—it accuses Sweden of harbouring terrorists. Sweden expects that a harsher anti-terror law, which came into effect on Thursday, will have satisfied Mr Erdogan’s demands.

The Senate passed a bill to suspend <strong>America’s debt ceiling</strong> until January 2025, allowing the government to [resume borrowing money](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/01/america-avoids-financial-armageddon-but-stays-in-fiscal-hell) and avoid an imminent sovereign default. America’s upper chamber voted 63-36 to approve the bill; 60 votes were needed to pass it. It is now up to President Joe Biden to sign it into law.

Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, urged <strong>Kosovo </strong>to hold new local elections after a disputed vote triggered weeks of violent unrest. In April, Kosovo’s [Serbian minority](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/20/kosovo-and-serbia-are-on-the-verge-of-conflict-again) boycotted an election in the north of the country, allowing the Albanian majority to elect a new slate of mayors on a turnout of less than 4%. Subsequent protests have injured 30 NATO peacekeepers and over 50 demonstrators.

<strong>Japan’s fertility rate</strong> fell for a seventh consecutive year in 2022, reaching a new low of 1.257 births per woman. The pandemic exacerbated the country’s woes of an [ageing](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/creating-new-adults-will-not-slow-japans-ageing) and [shrinking](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/11/26/the-challenges-of-japans-demography) population: deaths shot up by 9% to a record 1.57m last year, and marriage rates have slowed. The government plans to spend 3.5trn yen ($25bn) a year to support parents in the hope of reversing the trend.

White House officials said President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> was “fine” after he tripped over a sandbag and fell to the floor at a military graduation ceremony in Colorado. Similar stumbles have raised concern that Mr Biden, already America’s oldest president at 80 years old, is too frail to [run for a second term](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/25/joe-biden-fires-the-starting-gun-on-the-presidential-race).

## America continues its long jobs boom

In relative terms America’s labour market may be cooling a little. But in absolute terms it remains remarkably hot. According to data released on Friday by the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the economy added 339,000 jobs in May, almost double what economists had predicted. That is a significant increase from the 253,000 created in April, and marks the 29th straight monthly expansion. More worryingly, America’s unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7% in May, more than expected.

The strength of [the labour market](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/05/can-the-wests-perplexing-employment-miracle-continue) is testament to the economy’s resilience in the face of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest-rate increases. The worry for the central bank is whether the robust hiring will feed into big salary increases, thereby undermining its efforts to rein in inflation. There is not much evidence of that yet, wages grew by only 0.3% in May. Still, the longer that America’s job market remains ultra-hot, the bigger the risk of it spilling over into broader price pressures.

## Alphabet’s AGM

Google’s parent company, [Alphabet](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/23/its-time-for-alphabet-to-spin-off-youtube), holds its annual general meeting on Friday. Shareholders have lodged 13 proxy motions. They include a request for more information about how the firm’s algorithms work, and a plan to change shareholders’ voting rights. Currently Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the company’s co-founders, hold 12% of the firm’s stock but control 51% of shareholder votes. The proposal seeks a one-vote-per-share model. 

Yet activist investors should not expect change. In the past two years Alphabet has rejected every proxy motion. Instead, the firm’s management will highlight its progress in [artificial intelligence](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/26/big-tech-and-the-pursuit-of-ai-dominance). The company had been seen as lagging behind its rival Microsoft, which added AI features to its Bing search engine this February. But on May 10th Alphabet announced some 15 new AI products and features, including software to brush up users’ prose and to make music from text. Investors seemed happy. Whether the company can turn the features into profits remains to be seen.

## Cruising for a bruising in the South China Sea

On Friday a yacht called the<em> Dolphin</em> is expected to set sail from the western Philippines on a maiden cruise to the nearby Spratly Islands. Aboard will be 20 tourists of various nationalities. The cruise promises a week of good fishing and diving in the South China Sea—and, perhaps, the frisson of an encounter with armed and hostile Chinese mariners. That is because the <em>Dolphin</em> is bound for waters [disputed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/01/15/china-does-not-have-it-all-its-way-in-the-south-china-sea) by China and the Philippines. Their grey-zone tussle has the potential to drag America, which is [committed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/21/the-philippines-proximity-to-taiwan-makes-it-central-to-western-strategy) to defend the Philippines, into war with China.

The state-sanctioned cruise is intended to assert the legal right of the Philippines to exploit the disputed area for economic purposes. China asserts its claims in more [muscular fashion](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/06/21/china-has-militarised-the-south-china-sea-and-got-away-with-it): its coastguard or maritime militia craft scare off intruders by employing violent tactics, such as ramming boats or dousing their crews with hoses. The <em>Dolphin</em> will probably go unmolested. But a Philippine Coast Guard vessel will escort the yacht, just in case.

## Nepal’s prime minister visits India

On Friday Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepal’s prime minister, continues a four-day visit to India, his first trip abroad since he took office last year. Earlier in the trip he met his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi. The pair signed agreements on infrastructure investment and trade. They also promised to settle a border dispute through bilateral dialogue. 

Closer economic ties are good for both countries. Nepal wants India to invest in hydroelectric projects and to lower customs duties to reduce its trade deficit. India is keen to blunt China’s influence in the region. Over the years the two giants have [wooed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/03/20/china-and-india-take-opposite-approaches-to-a-crisis-in-nepal) Nepal: India is the country’s biggest trading partner, but China pumps in money to help build roads, dams and railways. America plays an important role, too. Last year Nepal’s parliament approved a $500m American aid package, angering China. When it comes to geopolitics, Nepal [faces a task](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/03/12/it-is-getting-harder-for-small-states-to-balance-great-powers) of Himalayan proportions to keep everybody happy.

## A Picasso show, by his detractors

About 50 exhibitions this year mark the 50th anniversary of Pablo Picasso’s death. But perhaps only one is curated by someone who hates him. “I really, really want to stick one up him,” Hannah Gadsby recently declared. The Australian comedian, who skewered [Picasso’s misogyny](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/05/picasso-was-a-genius-and-a-beast-can-the-two-be-separated) in “Nanette”, a stand-up special in 2018, has co-curated “It’s Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby”, an exhibition that opens on Friday at the Brooklyn Museum in New York.

It was arguably risky to hand the reins to an artist who has dismissed Picasso’s innovation of cubism as “a kaleidoscope filter on [his] cock.” Yet the show’s other curators insist that the exhibition is really about posing questions that challenge assumptions about [Picasso’s art and legacy](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/30/the-market-for-picassos-may-be-about-to-turn). As Catherine Morris, a senior curator for the museum’s feminist-art collection, explains: “If we wanted to cancel Picasso, we wouldn’t be giving him so much space.”
