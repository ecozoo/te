The <strong>United Auto Workers</strong>, one of America’s biggest unions, said talks with <strong>Ford</strong> had been “reasonably productive”. The union has called simultaneous [strikes](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/13/joe-bidens-love-of-unions-runs-into-a-giant-strike) at three carmakers’ plants—Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. (The UAW did not disclose how its negotiators fared at the other two.) Nearly 13,000 auto workers have downed tools. The union is seeking a 36% pay rise over four years; the companies have offered between 20% and 21%. 

## Le Pen and Salvini buddy up

Elections to the European Parliament do not take place until June 2024, but the campaign effectively gets under way on Sunday in Italy. Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s [hard-right](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/14/the-hard-right-is-getting-closer-to-power-all-over-europe) National Rally, will join Matteo Salvini, head of Italy’s populist League (previously called the Northern League), in Pontida, near Milan, for the Italian party’s annual jamboree. Ms Le Pen’s guest appearance, and speech, will transform the affair into a European campaign event.

The two leaders are hoping next year to boost their European parliamentary group, which also includes the hard-right [Alternative for Germany](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/14/germanys-rampant-hard-right-afd-puts-other-parties-in-a-fix) party. The gathering is also a chance for Ms Le Pen to remind the French at home that she has lost none of her drive. Polls suggest that the RN could top French voting at the European election, beating Emmanuel Macron’s centrist coalition into second place. Ahead of the next French presidential election in 2027, when Mr Macron cannot stand again, that would send [a tremor through Europe](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/14/a-fresh-wave-of-hard-right-populism-is-stalking-europe).

## Climate Week kicks off

“Our window of opportunity is about to close” is the stark message from Climate Group, the organisers of this year’s Climate Week, which begins on Sunday. The event will see business leaders, politicians and policy wonks—including Jim Skea, the new chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—gather in New York, where the high-level meetings of the UN General Assembly are also taking place from Monday. Film screenings and speaker sessions on environmental justice and sustainable living are scheduled around the city.

The gathering’s aim is to find ways to hold “those in positions of power” responsible for climate change. That feels urgent after months of record-breaking [heatwaves](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/07/19/are-heatwaves-evidence-that-climate-change-is-speeding-up) and[ extreme weather events](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/19/what-happens-when-extreme-weather-hits-several-places-at-once), and ahead of COP28, the UN climate summit taking place in the [UAE](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/09/07/the-gulf-countries-want-to-reshape-the-middle-east-in-their-image) from November 30th. The theme of this year’s Climate Week is “We can. We will”. The hope is that such determined words can encourage decisive action, too.

## Another show of Saudi sporting strength

Over the past two weeks 719 athletes from 117 countries have gathered in Riyadh for the World Weightlifting Championships, which is being held in Saudi Arabia for the first time. The event serves as the qualification route for the Olympics in Paris in 2024. The choice of location for weightlifting’s flagship tournament also carries extra significance. 

First, it is another display of [Saudi sporting ambitions](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/08/10/saudi-arabia-is-spending-a-fortune-on-sport). The country’s lavish spending on football and golf has grabbed more attention, but it is expanding its influence in even niche sports. Second, the tournament shows a softening in the kingdom’s stance towards Israel. On Sunday, the last day of competition, Israel’s David Litvinov will try to win the super-heavyweight division, following three compatriots in other categories. It is the first time Israeli athletes have ever been allowed into Saudi Arabia. The shift follows a slight rapprochement between the two countries in recent months, after years of hostility. But establishing genuine diplomatic ties will require much more heavy lifting.

## The sunnier side of Edvard Munch

In 1892 the Association of Berlin Artists invited Edvard Munch, then an obscure Norwegian painter, to stage a solo show. His unusual canvases caused such a scandal that it closed after one week. The modernist artist capitalised on the unexpected publicity by moving to Berlin, where he lived and worked for several periods on and off until 1908.

A new exhibition at the Berlinische Galerie, on until January, traces Munch’s influence on the city’s art scene. “Magic of the North” displays around 80 pieces, with paintings, photographs, lithographs and woodcuts. The works include portraits of Munch and his contemporaries in Berlin, such as Dagny Juel Przybyszewska, his muse. 

The controversy around Munch’s early exhibition in Berlin was driven, in part, by his paintings’ personal and psychological subject matter (best exemplified in “The Scream”, a [later work](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/04/24/the-personal-trauma-that-lies-behind-edvard-munchs-unnerving-art)). Visitors to the latest incarnation may be surprised by much brighter offerings, such as “Young People on the Beach”, painted in 1904.

## Weekend profile: Shikma Bressler, the unlikely face of Israel’s protests

Since Israel’s government revealed [its judicial-overhaul plans](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/16/binyamin-netanyahu-rushes-to-take-on-israels-supreme-court) in January, it has been on a collision course with the Supreme Court—and a particle physicist. Shikma Bressler has become the unlikely face of protests against the country’s [far-right coalition](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) government. This week, as the Supreme Court began discussing whether to strike down the government’s [first reform](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/14/the-judge-and-the-attorney-general-fighting-for-israeli-democracy) aimed at shrinking the judiciary’s powers, thousands of demonstrators again took to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Ms Bressler claims she never had any political ambitions. She normally works as a senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science. There she leads a research group that deals in other collisions: bashing particles into each other at the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN in Switzerland, to understand the universe’s fundamental building blocks. She has said that she longs to return to everyday life in the lab. 

Since March 2020, however, she has been in the political spotlight. At the time, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, was due to stand trial on corruption charges (which he denies). But [his trial was postponed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/07/23/binyamin-netanyahu-boasted-too-soon-of-defeating-the-coronavirus) when the courts were shut as part of the first coronavirus lockdown. In response, Ms Bressler and two of her brothers founded the Black Flags, a pro-democracy protest movement that spread across the country. When Mr Netanyahu was relegated to the opposition after the 2021 election, the group disbanded—but within 18 months, “Bibi”, as he is known, was back in office.

His plans to limit the judiciary’s power spurred Ms Bressler to return to the megaphone. Shortly before the first legal step of that plan passed, which in July ended [the Supreme Court’s ability](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/24/a-blow-against-israels-supreme-court-plunges-the-country-into-crisis) to use “reasonableness” as grounds to overturn government decisions, she led 20,000 people on a five-day march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Among her concerns are the decision’s implications for women’s rights in Israel.

Her campaign has not been without missteps. Last week she likened parts of the coalition to “Nazis” for their [views on Palestinians](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/05/26/meet-the-hype-man-for-binyamin-netanyahus-controversial-reforms), which Mr Netanyahu was quick to condemn as “an insult to the Holocaust” and an “incitement to murder”. Ms Bressler, who is Jewish, later apologised on X (formerly Twitter). Many of her fellow protesters, though, seem unlikely to hold it against her; like Ms Bressler, they see these demonstrations as the battle of a generation.
