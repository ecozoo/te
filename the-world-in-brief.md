<strong>Israeli troops</strong>, backed by drones and armoured bulldozers, continued an assault on a refugee camp in the city of <strong>Jenin</strong>—one of the largest incursions on the West Bank in 20 years. At least eight people have been killed and over 50 wounded since the attack began early on Monday, according to Palestinian officials. Israel’s army said it was targeting “terrorist infrastructure” belonging to the Jenin Battalion, a militia. Violence has [flared](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/06/29/settler-vigilantes-are-getting-more-violent-and-israels-government-is-encouraging-them) in the region in recent months. Israel’s foreign minister said there were no plans to widen the operation throughout the West Bank. 

## Macron meets the mayors

On Tuesday Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will host a meeting of more than 200 mayors of towns and suburbs that have been battered by nightly [violence and rioting](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/01/rioting-in-france-presents-a-fresh-political-test-for-emmanuel-macron) in the past week. Among them is Vincent Jeanbrun (pictured, gesturing), the centre-right mayor of L’Haÿ-les-Roses, a southern suburb of Paris, whose front gate was rammed with a car that was set on fire on Saturday night. Mr Jeanbrun’s wife broke her leg escaping with their children as fireworks were hurled at them. 

The[ rioting](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/29/dismay-and-violence-after-a-police-killing-in-france), which began after a teenage driver was shot dead by police during a traffic check on June 27th, seems to have peaked. But it obliged Mr Macron to cancel a state visit to Germany so that he could manage the crisis and meet the leaders of both houses of parliament. The president hopes that deploying tens of thousands of policemen will keep things calmer. His government will now start to unpick the reasons for the sudden social upheaval. 

## Putin returns to the world stage

On Tuesday Vladimir Putin will meet global leaders for the first time since the [Wagner rebellion](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/29/the-wagner-mutiny-has-left-vladimir-putin-looking-dangerously-exposed) rattled his regime. Russia’s president will participate in a virtual summit of the [Shanghai Co-operation Organisation](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-is-the-shanghai-co-operation-organisation), along with the leaders of China, India, Pakistan and former Soviet states in central Asia. In theory, the broad-based regional talking-shop should offer a welcome setting for Mr Putin to assure his counterparts that all is well in the Kremlin. The SCO is one of the few international groupings in which Russia still enjoys some support. 

Yet Mr Putin could yet face some awkward questions. India, for instance, the host of this year’s summit, is [moving towards the West](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/15/joe-biden-and-narendra-modi-are-drawing-their-countries-closer). Narendra Modi, its prime minister, has just concluded a state visit to America. At last year’s SCO summit Mr Modi urged the Russian leader to pursue peace in Ukraine. Kazakhstan’s leader has gone further than Mr Modi, directly criticising the war. Mr Putin will be hoping that his flagging invasion will not have emboldened them to go any further. 

## Germany’s resilient economy

On Tuesday Germany reveals its foreign trade figures for May. Going on the previous month, the outlook looks better than feared: in April, Destatis, the German statistics agency, reported an increase of 1.2% for that month, whereas a contraction of 2.5% had been predicted. Most notably in April, exports to China increased by 10.1% to €8.5bn ($9.3bn). That has also helped improve Germany’s long-standing trade deficit with its largest trading partner. German exports to America, the country’s biggest market, also increased, by 4.7% compared with March. That helped offset falling trade with Britain and a precipitous drop with Russia.

The data release comes as [investor sentiment](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/06/08/german-bosses-are-depressed) darkens over Germany’s technical recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth). The country’s manufacturing sector shrank in June as both new orders and production dwindled. Good news from the statistics office could help lift the gloomy mood.

## Australia’s monetary balancing-act

There are signs that interest rates are starting to bite down under. Australia’s annual inflation dropped to a 13-month low of 5.6% in May, from 6.8% in April. But GDP growth is also slowing. Will that prompt the Reserve Bank of Australia to hold interest rates at 4.1% when it meets on Tuesday? 

Analysts expect at least one more hike in the coming months. Core inflation (which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, as well as holiday travel) remains above the central bank’s target of 2-3%. The labour market remains tight and house prices, against the odds, are rebounding. 

The bank’s governor, Philip Lowe, says he wants to “keep the economy on an even keel”. But much more tightening and it could start to list. For many Australians, that would be a new experience. Barring a brief downturn during the pandemic, when wages were anyway subsidised, the country’s last recession ended over 30 years ago.

## Teachers rally in Florida

This week the National Education Association holds its annual meeting in Orlando, the “backyard” of Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. It is America’s biggest labour union’s first fully in-person conference since 2019, and will include a “Freedom to Learn” rally. The union opposes Mr DeSantis’s [education policies](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/26/ron-desantis-wants-to-limit-free-speech-in-the-name-of-free-speech), which they say curtail teachers’ and students’ rights. New laws in Florida that block discussion of race and sexuality have led teachers to reconsider how they teach the history of slavery, and school libraries to ban books such as Margaret Atwood’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>.

But Mr DeSantis seems to be digging in. The Republican presidential hopeful pitches himself as a defender of “parental rights”—against, implicitly, those of teachers. Other Republican governors have also accused teachers of indoctrinating pupils with critical race theory. At least eight states have enacted new so-called school-choice laws this year, such as giving residents vouchers they can use to pay private-school tuition, bypassing public education altogether.
