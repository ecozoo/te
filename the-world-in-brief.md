Maine became the second state in <strong>America </strong>to disqualify <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, the [overwhelming frontrunner](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/interactive/2024-republican-primaries-tracker) of the Republican primary race, from the primary ballot. Shenna Bellows, Maine’s secretary of state and a Democrat, ruled that Mr Trump had “engaged in insurrection”, making him ineligible to run for president under a provision in the 14th Amendment of the constitution. It follows a similar [ruling by Colorado’s supreme court](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/20/could-the-14th-amendment-bar-donald-trump-from-becoming-president-again) last week, which Mr Trump said he will appeal. 

## 2024 in preview: Moon missions are back

Next year NASA astronauts are due to [return to the Moon](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/astronauts-are-returning-to-the-moonwell-sort-of). Well, sort of. Four astronauts—Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Hammock Koch and Jeremy Hansen—will travel 7,400km beyond the Moon, swing around and return to Earth, without landing on the lunar surface. They will be the first humans to reach the vicinity of the Moon since those of Apollo 17 in 1972. 

It will be a thrilling year for space exploration. China will try to deliver another robotic lander to the Moon and Japan will launch its Martian Moons Exploration mission. NASA plans to launch <em>Europa Clipper</em>, a probe dedicated to studying the habitability of one of Jupiter’s moons, and the Indian Space Research Organisation aims to kick off its <em>Shukrayaan </em>mission to Venus. Private companies will also test new, reusable rockets, the most impressive of which is SpaceX’s <em>Starship</em>, which should manage to put 150 tonnes into orbit. Expect to see more trials of that behemoth in 2024.

## 2024 in preview: Smaller, better, faster, stronger AI

What to expect from AI in 2024? As large language models (LLMs) become commercial commodities, there is a growing focus on making them [smaller and faster](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/ai-models-will-become-smaller-and-faster). Small models, which can be squeezed onto fewer chips, are much less expensive to train and to run—some can even run on a laptop or smartphone.

Developers have been training smaller models with more training data. For instance, “Chinchilla”, an LLM developed in 2022 by Google DeepMind, outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-3, despite being a quarter of the size: it was trained on four times the data. Focus is also shifting from “how much” data to “how good”, as stocks of new, high-quality text are expected to gradually dry up. 

A bigger advance, however, will be in learning how to use them better. To enhance the accuracy of responses, for example, LLMs can be combined with extra software and a specialised database of knowledge. Showing what is possible has turned into figuring out what is practical.

## 2024 in preview: Watch out for CRISPR

[Gene-edited drugs](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/new-medical-treatments-will-use-genetic-scissors-and-other-clever-tricks) will make headlines in 2024. The first CRISPR drug, exa-cel, which made its historic arrival in late 2023, will treat sickle-cell disease and beta thalassaemia, two genetic blood disorders. CRISPR is a gene-editing technique that precisely cuts and edits DNA. The therapy, developed by Crispr Therapeutics and Vertex, edits stem cells extracted from a patient’s body. When returned, the edited cells counteract the genetic defect. The treatment is said to last a lifetime. But these drugs will cost more than $2m per patient, and for many around the world they will be impossible to obtain. 

The coming year will also see progress in gene-editing technology towards off-the-shelf treatments for cancer and diabetes. The workhorse of the immune system, the T-cell, can be gathered from donors and reprogrammed via gene-editing to fight cancer without triggering an immune rejection by the patient’s body. Similar technology could help diabetics by creating replacement insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

## 2024 in preview: More success for weight-loss drugs

After decades of disappointing weight-loss treatments, the arrival of safe and effective drugs is a milestone. Some now talk of a future without obesity. That is no small claim: obesity affects 1.1bn people, or roughly 14% of the world’s population. In 2024 Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, two pharma giants, will [battle for dominance](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/expect-a-bumper-year-for-weight-loss-drugs) of what could be a $77bn market by 2030, through their drugs Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide). 

More treatments are coming. Most are based on the same idea: glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, which keep people fuller for longer. They also affect the brain’s hypothalamus, which controls hunger, and may make fat more likely to break down. The catch is that you have to keep taking them. Eventually, though, taking obesity drugs every day may become widely accepted—especially if, as a recent paper suggested, they could reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as strokes and heart attacks, by 20%.

## Daily quiz

We will serve you a new question each day this week. On Friday your challenge is to give us all five answers and, as important, tell us the connecting theme. Email your responses (and include mention of your home city and country) by 1700 GMT on Friday to [<span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8cddf9e5f6c9fffcfee9ffffe3cce9efe3e2e3e1e5fff8a2efe3e1">[email&#160;protected]</span>](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=QuizEspresso@https://www.economist.com). We’ll pick randomly from those with the right answers and crown three winners on Saturday. 

<strong>Friday: </strong>What bird is associated in Britain with the arrival of spring, inspiring an orchestral work by Frederick Delius?

<strong>Thursday: </strong>What substance comprises between 45% and 75% of the human body?
