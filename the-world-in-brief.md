## The world in brief 2023-05-26

<strong>Ukraine </strong>said it shot down ten missiles and more than 20 [drones](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/08/how-ukrainians-modify-civilian-drones-for-military-use) which <strong>Russia</strong> launched at its capital, Kyiv, and eastern cities overnight. At least two people were killed and 23 more were injured in Dnipro after a missile hit a hospital there. In Kharkiv, a north-eastern city, a fire reportedly broke out in an oil depot after it was struck twice. 

President Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House, are reportedly close to reaching an agreement to raise <strong>America’s debt ceiling</strong>. According to Reuters, the proposal under consideration would cap government spending on most items and raise the debt ceiling for two years. Any [deal](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/19/could-the-14th-amendment-fix-americas-debt-ceiling-debacle) will need to pass the House and the Senate. The House adjourned on Thursday for a week-long break and the Senate is not in session, but lawmakers have been told they will need to return should a deal be reached.

A Singaporean judge ordered <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>, a collapsed [Swiss bank](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/19/a-momentous-but-unhappy-union-ubs-saves-credit-suisse), to pay $926mn to Bidzina Ivanishvili, Georgia’s former prime minister. The blow comes ahead of the finalisation of its takeover by UBS, a rival bank, next week. Mr Ivanishvili, also Georgia’s richest man, first sued the bank for the alleged fraudulent mismanagement of his money. Credit Suisse said it would appeal against the ruling and described the judgement as “wrong”.

Aleksandar Vucic, <strong>Serbia’s </strong>president, ordered army units towards the [border of Kosovo](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/20/kosovo-and-serbia-are-on-the-verge-of-conflict-again). Earlier a group of ethnic Serbs clashed with police in northern Kosovo while trying to block newly-elected officials from entering municipal buildings. Police fired tear gas; a police car was set on fire. Serbia’s defence minister, Milos Vucevic, said that it was clear that “terror against the Serb community in Kosovo is happening”.

The <strong>Turkish lira</strong> dropped to a record low ahead of the presidential run-off on Sunday, falling to 20 to the dollar. Since the election on May 14th, in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan gained a narrow lead, the Turkish lira has dropped by 2.1%. Foreign investors in the country are deeply sceptical of Mr Erdogan’s [flawed economic policies](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/14/recep-tayyip-erdogan-beats-his-challenger-as-turkey-votes). 

<strong>Neuralink</strong>, the brain-implant company owned by Elon Musk, received approval from America’s Food and Drug Administration to conduct its first human clinical trials. The company wants to insert [microchips into brains](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2022/09/22/crossing-the-brains-electrical-frontier) to help cure conditions such as autism, depression and schizophrenia. Neuralink said it would reveal details about its proposed study soon. Earlier this year the FDA had rejected a similar application on safety grounds. 

Scientists discovered more than <strong>5,000 new species</strong> in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a huge area of seabed in the Pacific Ocean that is soon to become a [deep-sea mining](https://staging2-backtoblue.https://www.economist.com/deep-sea-mining-time-for-a-deep-freeze/) hotspot. The newly found creatures, which include invertebrates such as sea urchins and sponges, were documented in a study in the journal <em>Current Biology</em>. The authors urged that the animals be protected, with mining operations looming.

<strong>Figure of the day: </strong>58%, the proportion of Republican primary voters that would vote for Donald Trump, according to polling conducted for <em>The Economist </em>by YouGov.

## Tensions inside Germany’s coalition

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine created such a sense of emergency in Germany that—for much of last year—tensions within the governing three-party [coalition](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/07/germanys-ruling-coalition-marks-its-first-anniversary) were swept under the carpet. But, as the war drags on, the pro-business Free Democratic Party and the Greens are increasingly getting into acrimonious fights. The latest is a row about a proposed law to ban the installation of new oil and gas boilers. The FDP is refusing to pass it, even though it had previously agreed to do so before the Bundestag breaks up in mid-June for summer holidays.

[Robert Habeck](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/30/pragmatism-paints-a-paler-shade-of-green), the embattled economy minister from the Greens, is accusing the FDP of breaking their word. The FDP says the law risks imposing too costly a burden on households. <em>Bild</em>, a tabloid, reported on Thursday that the FDP sent Mr Habeck 113 questions about the draft legislation. Though he supports the law, Olaf Scholz, the chancellor (from the coalition’s other party, the Social Democrats) is so far staying out of the scrap. 

## Sudan’s ceasefire hopes

The Sudanese people will spend the next few days anxiously waiting to see whether the current nationwide ceasefire is to be extended. The Sudanese Armed Forces, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, a militia led by Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, have been[ warring violently](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/03/sudans-war-is-home-grown-but-risks-drawing-in-outsiders) since April 15th. On Saturday, for the first time, they formally signed a deal to stop fighting—but only for seven days from Monday. The pause was to allow humanitarian aid into the country. That appears to have happened, albeit slowly. 

The omens for an extension, however, are not good. Residents of Khartoum, the capital, and elsewhere have reported plenty of fighting this week, despite the truce and vague warnings from America’s diplomats about the potential repercussions for both sides. The SAF and RSF seem to have plenty of fight left in them, which is terrible news for the Sudanese, over a million of whom have already been forced to flee their homes. 

## A bubbly market

Although most households are suffering from high inflation at the supermarket till and petrol pump, some can still splash out on luxuries. Online sales at upmarket clothing, jewellery and cosmetics makers like Hermès, LVMH and Richemont rose during the pandemic and have reached new heights since. [Bernard Arnault](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/20/how-bernard-arnault-became-the-worlds-richest-person), boss of LVMH, is now the world’s richest man. 

Another place to see this effervescence is at Laurent-Perrier, a French champagne maker, which reported its annual earnings on Friday. In the year to March 2023 revenues grew to €308m and net profit increased 16% to €59m. Laurent-Perrier’s profit margin is a fizzy 28%. The share price this month bubbled past €140, nearly double its level at the start of lockdown three years ago. The economy may be brut for many, but prospects are rosé for Laurent-Perrier.

## JPMorgan’s links to Jeffrey Epstein

Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, America’s biggest bank, will be deposed on Friday and Saturday in a pair of civil suits related to Jeffrey Epstein, a longtime client of the bank who hanged himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. The attorney-general for the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein lived on a private island, charges that JPMorgan obstructed law enforcement and, by providing financial services, facilitated his illegal activities.

The bank denies these charges, and instead claims that the government of the USVI was “complicit” in Mr Epstein’s crimes. On Tuesday the bank filed a case against the territory, alleging that high-ranking officials had “look[ed] the other way” in exchange for money and favours. Albert Bryan, governor of the USVI, will be deposed next month as part of the lawsuit. The USVI says this is an “obvious attempt” to shift blame away from JPMorgan. The finger-pointing continues. 

## A Keith Haring moment

In 1986 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam asked Keith Haring to put on an exhibition. It was the first major solo show for the 27-year-old street artist, who began his career creating hundreds of drawings in chalk on defunct advertising boards in the New York City subway. He was adamant that he shouldn’t be presented “simply as a ‘graffiti performer’”.

On Friday, for the first time in more than 30 years, the Stedelijk presents “Amsterdam Notes”, the 125-foot piece he created on the eve of that show. The museum’s director describes it as a “contemporary Bayeux tapestry”. It depicts human figures, monsters and animals dancing, flying and copulating.

A bigger collection of his work is showing at Akron Art Museum in Ohio until late September and an exhibition covering his entire career opens on Saturday at The Broad in Los Angeles. His vibrant work, which tackles themes such as the [AIDS epidemic](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/06/13/how-keith-harings-art-forced-us-to-talk-about-aids), racism and [war](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/prospero/2014/11/21/political-lines), is as urgent as ever.
