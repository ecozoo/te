<strong>Joe Biden</strong> will visit <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Jordan</strong> on Wednesday to reaffirm America’s support for Israel and try to prevent its conflict with <strong>Hamas</strong> from spreading through the region. In Jordan Mr Biden is expected to meet Mahmoud Abbas, the <strong>Palestinian</strong> president. Antony Blinken, [America’s secretary of state](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/16/to-save-palestinian-lives-in-gaza-open-the-crossing-into-egypt), said that his country and Israel had developed a “plan” to get aid into the Gaza Strip, after an earlier effort faltered. On Monday the <strong>World Health Organisation</strong> said that there are only “24 hours” of water, electricity and fuel left in the besieged enclave before a “real catastrophe” sets in.

## Xi’s Belt and Road bash

It is ten years since China launched its [Belt and Road Initiative](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/06/the-path-ahead-for-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative), a concrete-pouring binge powered by hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese loans and investment. On Tuesday and Wednesday the Communist Party plans to celebrate with a summit in Beijing. Representatives from over 130 countries are attending. The most prominent is [Vladimir Putin](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/19/what-does-xi-jinping-want-from-vladimir-putin), whom Xi Jinping visited in Russia earlier this year.  
  
 Western politicians, however, will be thin on the ground—and not just to avoid Mr Putin. BRI investments are smaller and more cautious than in the early years, when rich countries worried that China was trying to trap developing countries in debt. Yet increasingly [China](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/07/the-belt-and-road-as-seen-from-china) presents the scheme as only part of a [package of global projects](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/17/how-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-is-changing), which seek to spread not only ports and power stations but China’s democracy-free model of development.

## Israel’s war on Hamas’s tunnels

Students of urban warfare divide their battlefield into several planes: the sky, buildings and streetscape. But in Gaza tunnels will present the greatest challenge to the Israel Defence Forces when they begin [their invasion](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza) in the coming days. In 2001 the militants of Hamas began constructing a remarkable subterranean network, to smuggle arms from Egypt, conceal weapons and make raids into Israel for attacks and abductions. 

In 2014 the IDF launched an air and ground war targeting the tunnels and destroyed around 32 of them. Since then the IDF has invested heavily in tunnel operations, including new tech (such as robots that comb them with sensors) and specialised units. Its Yahalom battalion, an elite combat engineering unit, was reorganised, doubling from 400 to 900 personnel; it has even constructed its own versions of Hamas’s tunnels to practise on. Nonetheless, identifying, clearing and collapsing several hundred kilometres of underground warrens will take not weeks but years. 

## Lockheed’s mixed fortunes from war

Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company, reports quarterly results on Tuesday. Demands from defence ministries for munitions to support Ukraine and replenish national stocks remain strong. And Hamas’s assault on Israel caused American defence-industry stocks to leap by $30bn. But L-M’s earnings are expected to be slightly down year-on-year. Its share price before Hamas’s attack was its lowest since October 2022.

Arms spending within defence budgets is only creeping upwards. And L-M’s ability to accelerate the production of kit, such as the [HIMARS](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/21/how-two-new-munitions-could-affect-the-war-in-ukraine) ground attack system, fast enough to replace what is being used in Ukraine is restrained by shortages of rocket motors and skilled labour in America. 

What Ukraine needs most—artillery shells and short- to medium-range air-defence missiles—are relatively low-margin. Delays to deliveries of pricey F-35s, which accounted for 27% of net sales last year but are not directly affected by the war in Ukraine, are having a bigger impact on the bottom line.

## Paying American college athletes

In America college sport is a huge business. The Big Ten Conference, an American-football league of 14 universities, makes $1bn-plus annually from television networks airing its games. The highest-paid football coaches earn about $10m. Yet players are sidelined. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, a rule-setting body, prohibits them from being paid.

Several years ago some states began letting athletes [earn money from sponsorship deals](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/21/why-college-athletes-in-america-are-fighting-to-get-paid); now 31 do. The idea was that they might be compensated for the use of their name or image, if not for playing. State laws vary, however, and the NCAA wants a national standard. On Tuesday its boss will testify before the Senate about what a federal law should look like.  
  
 More significantly, the NCAA wants Congress to codify that athletes are “amateurs”. Athletes on sports scholarships can have tuition and board paid for. But they contend that they are in effect employees of their schools, which are breaking antitrust laws by refusing them fair-market wages.

## Media’s 2D turn

Sonic the Hedgehog will race back onto video-gamers’ screens on Tuesday, in Sega’s “Sonic Superstars”. Three days later Nintendo’s Mario will return in “Super Mario Bros. Wonder”. If the revived hedgehog-v-plumber rivalry inspires nostalgia in ageing gamers, so will the look of the games: both are [two-dimensional adventures](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/12/mario-and-sonic-the-hedgehog-lead-a-2d-turn-in-entertainment) of the sort last popular 30 years ago before 3D graphics took over.

The 2D revival has also come to Hollywood. Films about Spider-Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, both released this summer, ditched the 3D look pioneered by Pixar films like “Toy Story” back in 1995, in favour of a sketchbook-inspired look known as “2.5D”. Disney’s “Wish”, due out in November, has a similarly flattened style.

Animators are enjoying the chance to experiment. So are studio bean-counters. Whereas hyper-real 3D worlds can take many years to create, the new games were developed at Sonic speed. So far, audiences seem to find one fewer dimension no less fun.
