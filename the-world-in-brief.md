## The world in brief 2023-05-23

President Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House, failed to reach a deal to raise <strong>America’s debt ceiling</strong>, but vowed to keep talking. Both men described their hours-long meeting at the White House on Monday as “productive” and suggested an agreement was within reach. Earlier Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, warned that [failure to raise the debt ceiling](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/22/what-happens-if-america-defaults-on-its-debt) before June 1st could trigger a debt default.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of [Russia’s](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/21/russias-army-is-learning-on-the-battlefield) <strong>Belgorod</strong> region, said that several drones had been intercepted above his territory overnight. Mr Gladkov announced that a “counter-terrorism operation” is under way in the region, which borders Ukraine, a day after an incursion by pro-<strong>Ukrainian </strong>saboteurs<em>. </em>Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky, said that Ukraine has “nothing to do” with the events there. 

<strong>East Timor’s</strong> opposition party, the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, won 41% of votes cast in the country’s parliamentary election—just short of a majority. The party, led by <strong>Xanana Gusmao</strong>, the country’s first president, will thus have the chance to form a coalition. The ruling party, known as Fretilin, won only 25% of the vote. It vowed to accept this result. 

The [IMF](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/04/04/the-imf-faces-a-nightmarish-identity-crisis) said that<strong> Britain </strong>would not enter into a recession this year, revising earlier predictions that its economy would shrink by 0.3% in 2023. It now expects <strong>GDP</strong> to grow by 0.4%. The fund said that resilient demand had bolstered Britain’s ailing economy, but warned that the outlook for growth “remains subdued” and that inflation is still “stubbornly high”. 

A week-long ceasefire officially began in <strong>Sudan</strong> even as more air strikes and clashes were reported in Khartoum, the capital. Hundreds of people have been killed and more than 1m have fled their homes since fighting between the army and the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group, started last month. Previous [attempts at a truce](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-peacemaking-in-sudan) have all failed.

First Citizens, the new owner of <strong>Silicon Valley Bank</strong>, sued <strong>HSBC</strong>, a British lender, and several former employees for more than $1bn. The group is accused of engineering “a scheme to plunder” senior staff and confidential information from SVB after it [collapsed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/03/14/what-the-loss-of-silicon-valley-bank-means-for-silicon-valley) in early March. HSBC purchased SVB’s British entity days later, shortly before First Citizens acquired SVB. 

A <strong>fake image </strong>showing an explosion near the Pentagon went viral on <strong>Twitter,</strong> triggering a brief dip in stockmarkets. The picture, which appears to have been generated by <strong>AI,</strong> was shared by several verified accounts on the social-media platform including one that falsely claimed to be associated with Bloomberg News. The image was probably tweeted first by an account promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>1,788, the number of new TV series ordered by a Britain-based broadcaster or streaming platform in the year to April.

## Ukraine stocks up for its counter-offensive

On Tuesday EU defence ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the bloc’s support for Ukraine. In recent weeks France, Germany and Italy have all promised more military support, including air-defence systems, howitzers and drones. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, secured more pledges for weapons at the G7 summit in Japan on Sunday, including a new American package worth $375m. America also said that it would help to train Ukrainian pilots on [F-16 fighter jets](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/01/why-does-ukraine-want-western-jets-and-will-it-get-them), an important step towards Ukraine finally getting the warplanes.

The flurry of pledges comes as Ukraine prepares for its long-awaited [counter-offensive](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/12/a-renewed-push-on-bakhmut-fuels-rumours-of-a-ukrainian-counter-offensive). Yet analysts at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think-tank, suggest that Ukrainian success will probably rely more on [sound tactics](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/21/russias-army-is-learning-on-the-battlefield) than new weaponry. They note that Russia’s tactics have evolved substantially, notably in the deployment of infantry. Ukrainian forces will have to be dynamic to gain the initiative, breaking through Russian defences and exploiting gaps. 

## Modi goes Down Under

After meetings with leaders of G7 and Pacific island countries, Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, continued his diplomatic blitz on Tuesday with a visit to Australia. The relationship between the two countries has always been lacklustre. (According to one bad joke, every Australian government discovers India once.) But there is more now to give it spark, especially the countries’ shared [concerns about China](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/04/25/fearing-china-australia-rethinks-its-defence-strategy). Both sides feel the steely edge of Chinese expansionism—either through economic coercion or territorial clashes. They form one half of the Quad, a strategic grouping whose other members are America and Japan. They have stepped up military training with other Quad partners.

Trade has almost doubled since 2020. Last year Australia and India signed a free-trade agreement to boost it further. Yet perhaps the biggest source of unity is cultural. Indian migration to Australia has soared: Indians now make up its second-biggest ethnic diaspora community after the British. Mr Modi spoke to a packed stadium in Sydney; thousands of Indian-origin Australians were there to cheer him on. 

## The Bosnian Serb leader pays homage to Putin

Milorad Dodik, the president of Republika Srpska, the Serbian entity in Bosnia-Hercegovina, is in Moscow on Tuesday. He is attending a business meeting of the [Eurasian Economic Union](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/banyan/2014/05/30/where-three-is-a-crowd), a small Russian-dominated bloc of former Soviet states, and is expected to meet Vladimir Putin. 

Mr Dodik favours ties with Russia over those with the EU. He has so far prevented Bosnia from imposing sanctions on Russia. His actions have cost him friends in the West. Mr Dodik is under British and US sanctions for alleged corruption, which he denies, and for threatening regional stability. 

None of this jeopardises Bosnia’s EU candidacy, however, because Mr Dodik is now so isolated. He is going to Moscow to show that he still has one important friend. Mr Dodik and Mr Putin may discuss the building of a separate gas pipeline from Russia to Republika Srpska via Serbia. This would help give the Serbian bit of Bosnia energy independence from the rest of it, making Mr Dodik’s [secessionist ambitions](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/12/bosnia-is-on-the-brink-of-falling-apart-again) more achievable. 

## Shell’s shareholder strife

Shell had hardly begun its annual general meeting in London on Tuesday before proceedings were disrupted by protestors. Sir Andrew Mackzenie, the European oil giant’s chairman, was drowned out by cries of “go to hell, Shell! Shut down Shell!”. Last year’s AGM was similarly disrupted; almost a fifth of Shell’s shareholders then went on to vote against the board’s proposed strategy for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, regarding it as inadequate. 

The acrimony towards and within the company has risen further since. High energy prices have bestowed on the oil majors an [extraordinary glut of cash](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/06/where-on-earth-is-big-oil-spending-its-150bn-profit-bonanza). In February Shell posted annual net profits for 2022 of $42bn, more than double its earnings for 2021. That delighted some investors. Others are determined to force the company to do more to lessen the damage it has caused to the environment. Follow This, an activist investor group, has filed a resolution demanding that Shell slash greenhouse-gas emissions across its whole supply chain by 2030 by far more than it has promised. 

## The International Booker Prize

On Tuesday the International Booker Prize for fiction in English translation will be awarded. The £50,000 ($62,300) prize is split equally between author and translator. Leïla Slimani, a French-Moroccan journalist and novelist who chairs the jury, calls the shortlist of six books “very cool, very sexy”. 

Their authors include the 89-year-old, Guadeloupe-born doyenne of French fiction, Maryse Condé, and the Korean screenwriter-turned-cult-novelist, Cheon Myeong-kwan. Themes stretch from same-sex parenthood in Reykjavik (“Boulder”, by Eva Baltasar) to divisive nationalism (“Time Shelter”, a satirical work of science fiction by Bulgaria’s Georgi Gospodinov). “Standing Heavy”, by Ivorian author GauZ’, deals with the struggles of France’s migrant underclass. 

Ms Condé, the oldest author ever to be shortlisted, would be a popular winner. The visionary Mr Gospodinov would be a topical one. And a win for Mr Cheon’s fantastical family saga, “Whale”, would add another crest to Korea’s cultural wave.
