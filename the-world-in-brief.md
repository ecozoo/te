## The world in brief 2023-05-29

<strong>Recep Tayyip Erdogan</strong> secured [another five-year term](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/28/recep-tayyip-erdogan-is-re-elected-as-turkeys-president) as <strong>Turkey’s</strong> president after comfortably winning a run-off election. With nearly all ballots counted, he had received 52.1% of the vote; his challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, took 47.9%. Mr Kilicdaroglu called the result “unfair” but did not dispute it. “The only winner today is Turkey,” said Mr Erdogan. The lira neared a fresh record low, of about 20 to the dollar, following the results.

President Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House, expressed confidence that [their deal](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/28/americas-debt-ceiling-deal-means-it-should-now-avoid-armageddon) to raise America’s <strong>debt ceiling</strong> would pass Congress. Mr Biden had to make some compromises, including capping non-defence discretionary spending at 2023 levels for one year. Mr McCarthy attempted to quash talk of Republican opposition to the deal. The House votes on the agreement on Wednesday. 

Pedro Sánchez, <strong>Spain’s</strong> prime minister since 2018, called a<strong> general election </strong>on July 23rd. The vote was originally scheduled for the end of the year, but the socialist leader said that the results of local elections on Sunday—in which his [Spanish](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/23/a-rigorous-even-handed-history-of-modern-spain) Socialist Workers’ Party and Podemos, its junior ally, suffered defeat to conservative rivals—prompted him to hasten the electoral schedule.

<strong>North Korea</strong> told Japan that it plans to launch a satellite in the coming days, just weeks after Kim Jong Un said his country had built its first spy satellite. The Japanese government urged [North Korea](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/10/18/what-to-read-to-understand-north-korea) to keep it grounded. Japan also said it would “take destructive measures” against missiles landing in its territory; North Korea will need to use missiles for its launch. 

<strong>China’s</strong> first domestically produced passenger jet began its maiden commercial flight. It marks an important milestone in the county’s [efforts](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2020/05/07/chinese-carriers-restart-their-engines) to compete with Western firms, such as Boeing and Airbus. Yet the C919 jet—made by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China—still relies heavily on imported parts, including for its engines. China’s government wants to reduce that dependence, too.

<strong>Alexander Lukashenko</strong>, [the president of Belarus](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/05/22/what-happens-when-belarus-loses-its-dictator), said countries willing to “join the Union State of Russia and Belarus” would be given nuclear weapons. Mr Lukashenko, an ally of Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, said the Kremlin was transferring tactical nukes to his country. Earlier, a Belarusian opposition leader claimed Mr Lukashenko had been sent to hospital in Moscow after falling ill while meeting Mr Putin. The information is unconfirmed.

<strong>China</strong> will send its first civilian <strong>astronaut</strong> to space on Tuesday, according to officials. So far, all Chinese astronauts have been members of the People’s Liberation Army. Tuesday’s mission to the Tiangong space station is part of China’s [growing attempts](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/18/china-is-unusually-secretive-about-its-space-programme) to catch up with America’s space capabilities. It is aiming to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and establish a lunar base.

## Nigeria swears in a new president

Although the results of February’s election are still being contested in court, [Bola Ahmed Tinubu](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/02/15/asiwaju-bola-tinubu-on-why-he-is-running-to-be-nigerias-president) was sworn in as Nigeria’s president on Monday. Security forces have warned citizens to stay away from the inauguration in a bid to dissuade any protests from disgruntled voters. 

Mr Tinubu is inheriting a dire economy. He will have to grapple with soaring inflation, depleted foreign exchange reserves and a hefty debt burden—servicing it took up 96% of government revenues last year. He has [promised](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/16/africa-faces-a-mounting-debt-crisis) to remove costly fuel subsidies which would free up funds for necessary public investment (his predecessors reneged on similar pledges). Meanwhile, 63% of the country lives in poverty and unemployment levels are [forcing out its sprightly youth](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/02/24/a-young-persons-guide-to-escaping-nigeria). On top of all that, Nigeria’s [security crisis](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/23/insurgency-secessionism-and-banditry-threaten-nigeria) shows no signs of letting up. Mr Tinubu will need to work hard and fast to prevent the country plumbing new depths of despair.

## Rahul Gandhi visits America

On Monday Rahul Gandhi, India’s most prominent [opposition leader](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/26/relaunching-rahul-gandhi-again), kicks off a week-long tour of America. Mr Gandhi will meet business and civil-society leaders, politicians and members of the Indian diaspora across the country. The trip comes three weeks before Narendra Modi, the prime minister, embarks on a state visit to America—and a year before India’s general election. Anything Mr Gandhi says about his country’s democracy will be closely scrutinised at home. 

On Saturday a senior member of Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party said that the aim of Mr Gandhi’s tour was to “tear down India”. That rhetoric echoes the BJP’s response when the opposition leader highlighted the country’s democratic shortcomings during a similar trip to Britain in March. Mr Gandhi has since been [disqualified](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/27/the-worlds-biggest-democracy-is-becoming-less-free) from parliament after being given an unusually harsh sentence in a defamation case. When talking about threats to India’s democracy, Mr Gandhi has plenty of material to work with.

## Hong Kong exports

Ten years ago a 50-foot, inflatable duck arrived in [Hong Kong’s](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/11/a-winner-has-emerged-in-the-old-rivalry-between-singapore-and-hong-kong) Victoria Harbour, providing a surreal backdrop for tourist photographs. In June, the duck—now with a mate—will return, even bigger than before. Along with the kitsch, the crowds are also coming back. Arrivals from mainland China reached almost 2m in March. That is helping the city’s economy to reflate. Its GDP grew by a faster-than-expected 5.3% in the first quarter, compared with the previous one. 

The city’s government, unlike the mainland’s, has generously supported consumption, disbursing electronic vouchers worth HK$3,000 ($380) to residents in April. Yet one weak spot is the export of goods. Figures out on Monday showed that in April goods exports shrank year-on-year for the 12th month in a row. Still, most of the merchandise that Hong Kong exports was made elsewhere. Its economy now relies instead on providing services, including [tourist attractions](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/23/hong-kongs-most-famous-floating-restaurant-sinks), like giant yellow ducks bobbing in front of a spectacular skyline.

## An anniversary on Mount Everest

Monday marks 70 years since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, intrepid climbers from New Zealand and Nepal, first scaled [Mount Everest](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/03/12/new-rules-to-limit-numbers-on-everest-are-delayed). The number of people summiting the world’s largest mountain [has surged](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/09/20/more-people-are-climbing-to-the-top-of-mount-everest-than-ever-before) in recent decades. During the current climbing season, Nepal issued 478 permits to make the climb, the highest ever, contributing $5m to the state’s coffers. Earlier this month, Kami Rita, a 53-year-old Nepali, reached the top for a record 28th time.

But the [rush](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/05/11/how-mount-everest-went-mainstream) may soon reach its peak. This year’s season has been among the deadliest ever; eight climbers died and five are missing. Both [rubbish](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/international/2018/10/27/how-to-dispose-of-human-waste-on-mount-everest) and rising temperatures ravage the mountain. Melting glaciers transport human waste laced with steroids—which straggling climbers consume on their ascent—to the lowlands, polluting the local water supply. According to a recent study published in <em>Nature</em>, a journal, Everest’s glaciers have lost 2,000 years’ build up of ice between 1989 and 2019. For all its majestic glory, man-made troubles increasingly haunt the climb.

## Alexander the Great’s cultural legacy

In recent years there have been a spate of exhibitions that deal with the rise, demise and splendour of empires. Italy’s national archaeological museum in Naples joins the discussion on Monday, opening an exhibition devoted to the empire that [Alexander the Great](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/01/05/alexander-the-great-and-the-birth-of-the-modern-world) conquered in the 4th century BC. By the age of 30 the [Macedonian king](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/03/19/the-tricky-politics-of-tearing-down-statues-of-alexander-the-great) ruled a state that stretched from Greece to India. The exhibition focuses on the cultural effects of this violent clash between west and east. 

Alexander’s empire was as short-lived as it was huge, barely surviving his death in 323BC. But it left a legacy in art and thought that lasted much longer. Visitors to the show in Naples will be able to watch restoration work taking place on a vast and vividly violent mosaic that depicts a battle between Alexander and Darius III of Persia. The so-called Alexander Mosaic, which was found in Pompeii, is more than five metres wide. Its repair is a fitting tribute to Alexander’s cultural impact.
