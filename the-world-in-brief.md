<strong>Michigan’s</strong> attorney-general charged 16 people with eight felony counts each for attempting to hand the state’s electoral votes to <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in America’s 2020 election. The “false electors” wrongly certified that Mr Trump had won in Michigan; in fact Joe Biden prevailed there by about three percentage points. Earlier Mr Trump said federal prosecutors had warned him that he is a “target” of their [investigation](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/25/how-donald-trumps-trials-and-the-republican-primary-will-intersect) into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Such letters often precede indictment. 

## Tesla hits speed bumps

Tesla’s first cybertruck, a futuristic rendering of the all-American pickup, rolled off production lines just days ago. But now Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle company [must return](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/18/teslas-surprising-new-route-to-ev-domination) to more mundane concerns. Tesla is in a race with the rest of the car industry; its second-quarter results, due on Wednesday, will show how it is faring. 

  
 Investors will watch for Tesla’s operating margins, which last year were around 17%, a stratospheric figure next to those of older, clunkier car-makers. Tesla prides itself on doing things differently from its established rivals. But slowing growth in demand and rising inventories forced it to start slashing prices late last year. The subsequent pace of price-cutting by Tesla and its competitors has accelerated quickly. China’s government recently demanded the company and its Chinese rivals sign a letter promising to respect “core socialist values” and compete fairly. Margins may slip below the first quarter’s 11%, closer to the performance of conventional firms Tesla once left trailing. 

## Thailand’s possible PM tries again

On Wednesday Thailand’s parliament is due to vote—again—on installing a new prime minister. It is the second attempt by Pita Limjaroenrat, a young liberal, to claim the post and end nine years of military rule. His pro-democracy Move Forward party scooped the most votes in a general election in May, but he failed to win a parliamentary ballot on July 13th. Despite the backing of an eight-party alliance, he will probably fail again, because he poses an existential threat to those voting. 

Mr Pita wants to dismantle Thailand’s [monarcho-military establishment](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/18/the-humiliation-of-thailands-regime-is-a-boost-for-asian-democracy), which is now firmly rallied against him. Of the 249 senators in parliament, appointed by the army, only 13 voted for him the first time. That number is unlikely to change much. Meanwhile, the country’s subservient judiciary is toying with disbarring him from office—presumably at the behest of his opponents. Thailand still has a long way to go before the public is guaranteed to get the leaders it votes for. 

## Britain’s inflexible inflation

British inflation data for June are published on Wednesday. Recent readings have indicated that [inflation is stickier in Britain](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/21/britains-inflation-pain-is-mostly-self-inflicted-and-getting-worse) than in comparable countries. Most worrying for the Bank of England, sub-indices have shown that price growth is particularly strong in services. That is despite falls in the headline rate of inflation since its peak in October, thanks to lower fuel costs and a slowing rate in the increase of prices for food. Traders are now predicting that the central bank will raise interest rates further and faster than previously planned, and are betting on them hitting or exceeding 6% by February. 

Economists expect that the figures for June will, broadly, tell the same story. The producer price index, which measures the cost of products leaving factories, has fallen sharply over the past year, suggesting disinflationary pressures. Nominal wage growth, though, has remained strong, suggesting that inflation is becoming more embedded in services, which are more labour-intensive. High prices are proving hard to shake.

## Unrest continues in Peru

Peruvians plan to take to the streets of Lima again on Wednesday. It will be their third [big march](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/19/perus-political-chaos-looks-likely-to-persist) in the capital since December, when Pedro Castillo, the president, was arrested after trying to dissolve Congress to prevent his own impeachment. Protesters are expected to demand the removal of Dina Boluarte, Mr Castillo’s successor and former deputy, the bringing forward of general elections scheduled for 2026 and the drafting of a new constitution. 

At first the protests were mainly supportive of Mr Castillo. Yet the crowd changed after Ms Boluarte blamed the insurrection on terrorist groups, without evidence. The ensuing crackdown by police and the military left over 60 people dead. In June, when another protest was announced, Ms Boluarte asked, “How many more deaths do they want?” and swore to stick around until 2026. But her approval rating has recently dropped to just 14%. Her road ahead looks rocky. 

## England try to level the Ashes

The men’s Ashes, a best-of-five Test-cricket series between England and Australia, has so far produced three close matches. They have been played at a frenetic pace and packed with controversy. Australia lead the series by two to one. That means England need to win the fourth match, which begins on Wednesday in Manchester, to stop their opponents retaining the Ashes. 

The drama is a boon for broadcasters. Sky Sports, which owns the British TV rights, recorded its highest-ever average viewing figures for a Test during the third game, at 965,000. But that is lower than the average of around 2.5m that watched the Ashes in 2005, when Test cricket was last broadcast on free-to-air TV. The England and Wales Cricket Board argued that putting [cricket](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/13/england-may-soon-become-the-worlds-best-cricket-team) behind a paywall would help secure the sport’s financial future. Yet other bodies, like Cricket Australia, opted to keep home Test matches free to view. The old foes have different styles in more ways than one.
