At least seven people were injured in an attack by a 20-year-old Palestinian man in <strong>Tel Aviv</strong>, which Hamas hailed as the “first response to Israel’s crimes against our people in <strong>Jenin</strong>”. The assailant, who ran over and stabbed civilians, was shot dead at the scene. Israel’s military operation against a refugee camp in the city of Jenin is its biggest raid on[ the West Bank](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/03/israel-launches-its-biggest-raid-on-the-west-bank-in-over-20-years) in over 20 years. Some 3,000 Palestinians fled and at least ten have been killed since the incursion began early on Monday. Palestinians accused Israel of a war crime.

## High prices stick around in Turkey

Turkey’s annual inflation rate fell below 40% in May, down from its peak of 86% last autumn. On June 22nd the central bank [raised rates](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/04/turkeys-president-erdogan-shifts-towards-sane-economics) by 6.5 percentage points. You might think that would further depress the country’s rampant inflation. But as data to be released on Wednesday is expected to show, the drop has slowed, and may soon go into reverse.

The reasons for Turkey’s sticky inflation are twofold. A tightening regime launched by the central bank’s new governor, which followed nearly two years of [reckless interest rate cuts](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/22/turkish-property-prices-are-soaring), has underwhelmed. At 15%, the benchmark interest rate remains far below the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, [sales of foreign reserves](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/01/turkeys-bizarre-economic-experiment-enters-a-new-phase) by the central bank—used to prop up the Turkish lira ahead of [elections](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/04/27/a-post-erdogan-turkey-would-only-partly-change-its-foreign-policy) in May, so as to help Mr Erdogan’s chances— have slowed. The combination has set off another run on the currency. The lira has lost more than 20% of its dollar value in the past month. Another wave of inflation may be starting to swell.

## Ukraine wants cluster bombs

[Ukraine’s army](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/the-war-in-ukraine-shows-how-technology-is-changing-the-battlefield) has consolidated bridgeheads at three points over the Dnieper river south of the destroyed Kakhovka dam. It has continued to make gains around the eastern town of Bakhmut. But attacks in the south, in Zaporizhia and Donetsk provinces, have been frustratingly slow, with Russian units mounting a tougher defence than expected.

Ukrainian and Western officials say that [cluster bombs](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z)—weapons which release a large number of small bomblets over a wide area—would make a [big difference](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/07/why-are-cluster-munitions-so-dangerous) in assaulting dug-in positions. The White House has been wary of sending them because most of its allies—though not Ukraine—are signatories to a treaty that bans the munitions, which can pollute a battlefield long after a war is over. Ukrainians retort that Soviet-era cluster bombs have already been scattered by both sides, and that American ones have far lower dud rates. America seems to be leaning their way.

## A celebration of stagnation in Venezuela

Venezuela celebrates 212 years of independence on Wednesday, with a large military parade planned in Caracas. Preparations have not gone well. One of the country’s Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30 fighter aircraft crashed during rehearsals last week, killing a pilot. 

[Nicolás Maduro](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/25/nicolas-maduro-venezuelas-autocrat-is-winning), the president, may not attend the main ceremony. He often avoids open-air public events after two drones, apparently directed at him, exploded in 2018. Otherwise, the autocrat is sitting comfortably in power. [Juan Guaidó](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/01/26/juan-guaido-wins-diplomatic-recognition-as-venezuelas-president), a Western-backed rival, has gone into exile. 

Despite Mr Maduro’s poor record—the economy has shrunk by 75% and a quarter of the population has emigrated during his decade in power—he is expected to stand for another six-year term in 2024. He also seems set on rigging that election: last week his government revealed that the opposition front-runner, Maria Corina Machado, is barred from holding political office for 15 years on various trumped up charges, mostly linked to her support of US sanctions on Venezuela.

## The NHS turns 75

On Wednesday Britons will cheer their [National Health Service](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/25/how-to-fix-the-nhs) with pageantry befitting a royal jubilee. A special service at Westminster Abbey will praise the institution. The George Cross—the highest medal awarded to civilians for bravery, given to the NHS during the covid-19 pandemic—will begin its celebratory tour of the nation. For most people, the celebrations will not feel overdone. A poll published this week found that over half of Britons say the NHS makes them most proud to be British—far more than are most proud of history, their culture or the royal family.

Yet all is not well on the hallowed wards. Hospital waiting lists, at 7.4m, continue to spiral. Junior doctors are planning more industrial action in the coming weeks; public satisfaction in NHS services bumps along the floor together with [staff morale](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/30/the-nhs-in-england-gets-a-plan-for-fixing-its-broken-workforce). Life expectancy in Britain is falling behind that of its near neighbours. The government talks the right talk about fixing the NHS; their current plans are nowhere near enough.

## African photography at Tate Modern

The first major show of contemporary African photography at Tate Modern in London opens with portraits of Nigerian monarchs by George Osodi, a Nigerian artist. In one image an elderly king wears a beaded headpiece and robes printed with the face of Queen Elizabeth II. He sits resplendent, evoking—in the words of the curator—“traditions [that] have been somewhat forgotten”.

The exhibition, titled “A World in Common”, features 36 artists. Some confront the exploitation of people and land. Others look inward, dwelling on family histories, rituals and spiritual themes. The result is a delightful kaleidoscope that makes no attempt to present one narrative or experience of the continent. Consider it a long-overdue challenge to the reductive depictions of Africa by camera-touting colonialists in the 19th century. Luckily museum-goers elsewhere can savour the work of African photographers this summer: similar shows are on at the Detroit Institute of Arts and New York’s MoMA.
