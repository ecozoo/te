The grand jury in<strong> Georgia</strong> investigating <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election delivered ten indictments. More details, including the names of those charged, are to be revealed later on Monday night. Mr Trump has already been [indicted three times](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) this year. The investigation in Georgia reportedly stems from a phone call Mr Trump made to Brad Raffensperger, the state’s top election official, asking him to “find 11,780 votes” to reverse his loss in the state.

## Narendra Modi celebrates

Delhi will be awash with tricolour flags on Tuesday as India celebrates 76 years of independence. [Narendra Modi](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/narendra-modi-is-the-worlds-most-popular-leader), the prime minister, who will speak on the occasion at the Red Fort in Delhi, has more reason to celebrate than most. With less than a year to go until a general election, around 75% of Indians approve of the way he runs the country. In parliament last week he easily deflected the latest attempt by the opposition to hold his government to account for its handling of a deadly ethnic conflict in the north-eastern state of [Manipur](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/29/ethnic-conflict-drags-on-in-manipur-in-indias-north-east) (Mr Modi has not visited the state since violence erupted in early May). 

America and other Western countries, keen to enlist India in their geopolitical rivalry with China, are keeping largely mum about the government’s Hindu-nationalist ideology, the attacks on civil society and the increasingly aggressive sidelining of India’s 200m Muslims. Nine years into the job, Mr Modi is sitting tighter than ever.

## Rising anxiety about China’s economy

President Joe Biden is among those now worried about China’s economy. Thanks to an ageing population and weak hiring, China is a “ticking time-bomb”, he said at a fundraiser this month. “So they got some problems,” he concluded. On Tuesday China’s government will provide an update on the precise size of these problems. 

New data may show that youth unemployment in China’s cities, which reached 21.3% in June, rose again in July, as more graduates finished their studies and began looking for work. Other figures will reveal whether the recovery in services, like catering, is abating or spreading to big-ticket consumer goods. 

This month China has already reported [declining consumer prices](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/10/deflation-and-default-haunt-chinas-economy), a precipitous drop in exports and alarmingly weak demand for credit. On top of all that, Mr Biden’s government has imposed new [limits](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/10/joe-bidens-china-strategy-is-not-working) on American investment in the country. If China does indeed have problems, Mr Biden is one of them.

## Investigating America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan

Two years ago on Tuesday images of desperate Afghans climbing onto American cargo planes to escape the [Taliban](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/01/life-under-the-rule-of-the-taliban-20) shocked the world. On August 15th 2021 Kabul fell when Afghanistan’s government surrendered after a [chaotic final withdrawal](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/08/21/the-fiasco-in-afghanistan-is-a-grave-blow-to-americas-standing) of American and coalition troops. Thousands of Afghans who had worked with the Americans (and others) were stranded. 

The humanitarian crisis marked a bitter end to a 20-year war. Republicans refuse to let President Joe Biden, who completed the hasty withdrawal begun by Donald Trump, forget. Michael McCaul, a congressman from Texas, claims that the Biden administration had no evacuation plan and has subpoenaed documents from the State Department. Despite receiving some records, Mr McCaul remains unsatisfied and has given the department until Wednesday to produce further material.

Democrats suspect Mr McCaul is unlikely to uncover significant new information. Some Republicans doubt the public even [cares](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/19/americans-views-on-the-afghanistan-withdrawal-run-along-party-lines). To the Afghans left behind, [routes to safety](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/11/27/scammers-are-preying-on-afghans-desperate-to-leave-their-country) that do not involve smugglers and dinghies may matter more.

## An international force for Haiti

Discussions will intensify this week about an international peacekeeping force for Haiti. A request last year by the country’s prime minister, Ariel Henry, for help to combat rampant gang violence received [widespread backing](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/20/an-american-backed-foreign-force-may-be-sent-to-haiti), including from the UN. But the process stalled when no country was willing to take the lead. Last month Kenya offered to do so, and America said it would be willing to sponsor a resolution for the UN Security Council to authorise a deployment. 

The Kenyan offer of 1,000 police has been controversial, given the force’s poor human-rights record at home. In any case, Haitians dislike the idea of more foreign boots in their country. But they see no other way to tame [the chaos](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/19/why-is-haiti-so-difficult-to-govern). Since the assassination of the former president, Jovenel Moïse, in July 2021, there have been no elections in Haiti. Killings, kidnappings and sexual abuse have increased dramatically, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch, a lobby group. Even with international intervention, an end to Haiti’s misery seems far off.

## Home Depot’s housing problem

On Tuesday Home Depot, America’s largest home-improvement retailer, reports its second-quarter earnings. Its profits have probably slid: as the housing market cools, American shoppers are spending less on DIY materials and expensive items like patio furniture and barbecues. 

America’s benchmark interest rate is at its highest in over two decades, putting off homebuyers—4m existing [homes](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/12/is-the-global-housing-slump-over) were sold in the year to June, a fall of 3.3% on the previous 12 months. Foreign investors are also retreating. International buyers bought around 85,000 American homes between April 2022 and March this year, the fewest since this data was first tracked in 2009. 

There is some good news on the horizon. [Inflation](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/26/americas-battle-with-inflation-is-about-to-get-trickier) is gradually subsiding, a sign that the Federal Reserve’s policy of raising interest rates is working. Investors now expect the Fed to start cutting rates in 2024. That should encourage borrowing, and shopping. Home Depot will have to endure the pain for just a little longer.
