## The world in brief 2023-05-22

The <strong>EU</strong> fined <strong>Meta</strong>, which owns Facebook and Instagram, €1.2bn ($1.3bn) for failing to comply with its [privacy rules](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/01/is-the-eu-overreaching-with-new-digital-regulations) and ordered the company to suspend transfers of user data to America. It is the largest fine to be imposed on a big tech company in the bloc. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, one of the EU’s privacy watchdogs, said that Facebook did not properly protect the data of European users against American surveillance programmes. 

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of <strong>Russia’s</strong> Belgorod region, which borders <strong>Ukraine</strong>, said that a Ukrainian “sabotage group” had entered Russian territory. In a statement Mr Gladkov said that [Russian forces](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/21/russias-army-is-learning-on-the-battlefield) were taking steps to repel the attack. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior advisor to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that Ukraine has “nothing to do” with the events in Belgorod.

<strong>China’s</strong> vice foreign minister said <strong>Japan</strong> and the <strong>G7</strong> colluded to “smear and attack China” and summoned the Japanese ambassador to Beijing to protest against the “hype around China-related issues”. The <em>Global Times</em>, a state-backed tabloid, called the [G7 summit](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/16/can-the-west-win-over-the-rest-of-the-world), hosted by Japan, an “anti-China workshop”. On Saturday the G7 condemned China’s “economic coercion” and “militarisation activities” in the [South China Sea](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/10/how-the-nine-dash-line-fuels-tensions-in-the-south-china-sea). 

<strong>Belarus</strong> pardoned <strong>Roman Protasevich</strong>, a Belarusian journalist and activist, according to state media. In May 2021 Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, forced a Ryanair passenger plane to make an unscheduled stop in his capital in order to [arrest Mr Protasevich](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/05/26/having-hijacked-a-ryanair-plane-belarus-draws-closer-to-russia). He was later sentenced to eight years in prison. In a video the 28-year-old said he was “insanely grateful” to the president for pardoning him. 

Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of <strong>America’s</strong> House of Representatives, said that talks on raising the country’s <strong>debt-ceiling</strong> between him and President Joe Biden would continue on Monday. The pair spoke on the phone after Mr Biden called Republican demands—which include heavy spending cuts—“unacceptable” at a press conference at the end of the G7 summit. [Negotiations](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/19/could-the-14th-amendment-fix-americas-debt-ceiling-debacle) have grown increasingly heated in recent days.

<strong>America’s</strong> secretary of state, Antony Blinken, signed a defence deal with <strong>Papua New Guinea</strong>. The pact will make it easier for the countries’ forces to train together; America also promised to help PNG respond to disasters. Earlier, India pledged its support for PNG and other [Pacific islands](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/06/what-pacific-island-states-make-of-the-great-power-contest-over-them) at a regional summit. Both America and India are keen to counter China’s influence in the Pacific. 

<strong>Ryanair </strong>reported a better-than-forecasted profit of €1.4bn ($1.5bn) for the year ending in March, as air travel rebounded after the covid-19 pandemic. The Irish low-cost carrier hopes to double annual passenger traffic to 300m by 2034. In an interview with the <em>Financial Times</em>, Michael O’Leary, the airline’s abrasive boss, said “We will continue to wipe the floor with every other airline in Europe.”

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$31.8m, the record amount fetched at auction in 2020 by “Stan”, a <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> skeleton. [Read the full story](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/17/the-market-for-dinosaur-fossils-is-booming).

## America’s debt-ceiling drama intensifies

President Joe Biden, having left the G7 summit in Japan on Sunday, had hoped to tie a bow on a debt-ceiling deal on his return to Washington. Instead, he looks likely to land squarely in the middle of high-stakes negotiations.

Republicans have been pressing for big spending cuts, and Kevin McCarthy, speaker of the House of Representatives, feels that he must secure them to keep his fractious caucus together. The Democrats, meanwhile, have been resisting them, and progressives in the party have warned that they might reject any deal perceived as a capitulation by Mr Biden’s administration.

The Treasury will use up its cash buffers as soon as June 1st, which means politicians have a fast-closing window in which to reach agreement. A [no-deal scenario](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/15/what-america-does-after-a-debt-ceiling-disaster)—which could trigger an American default, a devastating prospect for global markets—ought to be unthinkable, but anyone watching the negotiations closely is finding it harder to ignore.

## Great powers in the Pacific

The leaders of at least 14 Pacific countries convened in Papua New Guinea on Monday, for two separate meetings: one with Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state; the other with Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister. The gatherings are a sign of the region’s growing strategic importance. 

The Pacific is, increasingly, the locus of a power struggle between America and China. China used aid and investment to[ increase its influence](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/02/chinas-interest-in-the-pacific-islands-is-growing) there over the past decade; America mostly snoozed. It received a rude awakening in 2022 when China reached a security agreement with the Solomon Islands, and has been playing catch-up since.

Mr Blinken duly signed a defence pact with the prime minister of PNG, James Marape. The deal will make it easier for the countries’ forces to train together, and America said that it will help to beef up PNG’s disaster relief and humanitarian responses. Many Pacific islanders, however, are not enamoured with the plan: they fear militarisation and dislike their region being an arena for competing superpowers. 

## Britain and Switzerland talk trade

A first round of talks is beginning in London on Monday on another post-Brexit free-trade agreement, between Britain and Switzerland. The existing set-up, signed in 2019, replicates the latter’s piecemeal arrangements with the EU. Later deals added some flexibility for working between the two countries and provided mutual standards for some goods. 

Switzerland is Britain’s fourth-biggest market, after the EU, America and China. Last year it was the recipient of £33bn-worth ($41bn), or 4.1%, of British goods and services. That is three times more than Australia, with which Britain struck a much-ballyhooed free-trade deal in 2021. After that comes into force this month it is forecast to add just 0.08% a year to GDP by 2035.

Most goods already pass between Britain and Switzerland without tariffs. Prospective gains therefore will mainly be found in [services](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/05/09/britains-services-exports-are-booming-despite-brexit-why)—especially finance, which is a speciality of both countries. Between haggling sessions, the Britons might also seek advice on battles with the EU, in which the Swiss have much experience.

## Tim Scott’s long-shot presidential bid

On Monday Tim Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina, is expected to [formally launch his campaign](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/13/why-tim-scott-is-such-a-long-shot-for-the-republican-nomination) for America’s presidency. Hardly anyone in the party has a bad word to say about Mr Scott, who grew up in poverty with a single mother to become the first African-American senator to represent a Southern state since 1881. 

Mr Scott is no belligerent ideologue. His congressional record highlights his championing of “opportunity zones”—a tax-incentive scheme to revitalise deprived neighbourhoods—and for a bipartisan effort at police reform that eventually foundered.

Yet his willingness to work across the aisle may end up working against him. Modern Republican voters expect a culture warrior, and polling suggests just 2% support Mr Scott. He clearly feels that playing the part will help his chances, however. In a recent video he warned that empowering the “radical left” would trap families in “failing schools” and “crime-ridden neighbourhoods”. Some think he could ride the role into a vice-presidential position.

## Hwang Ji-hae lets nature take its course

Hwang Ji-hae’s last submission, in 2012, to the Royal Horticultural Society Chelsea Flower Show—the gardening world’s equivalent to Wimbledon, held in London each year—was inspired by the demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea. The landscape artist’s garden reproduced the scars left behind by the Korean war almost 60 years before, and the wildlife that has since grown over it like stitches. It won the President’s Award, one of Chelsea’s most coveted prizes. 

Ms Hwang will further explore the restorative power of nature in this year’s show, which opens to the press on Monday and the public the following day. Her entry is based on the rocky outcrops of Jirisan, the highest mountain on the South Korean mainland, and its medicinal herbs, many of which are now endangered. Ms Hwang hopes that, in contemplating the plants that saved human lives before modern medicine, visitors will better understand humans’ place in the natural world, and the ways in which each can heal the other.
