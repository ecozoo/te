Antony Blinken, <strong>America’s</strong> secretary of state, urged <strong>Israel </strong>to seek a “practical pathway” to a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza is over. In meetings with Israel’s prime minister, <strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong>, and other officials, Mr Blinken emphasised the need to plan for a long-term solution to the conflict. He also urged Israel to do more to avoid civilian casualties in [Gaza](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas) and pushed for further aid to be allowed into the territory. Meanwhile Hizbullah, a Lebanese militant group, launched drone strikes against an Israeli command post.

## Blinken’s never-ending Middle East diplomacy

Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, arrived in Israel on Tuesday—his fourth visit since October. During a five-day regional tour he is attempting to keep the war between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, from turning into a bigger regional conflagration. During a stop in Qatar he warned that the conflict “could easily metastasise”. It arguably already has.

On Monday an Israeli air strike in southern Lebanon killed a commander of the Radwan force, an elite commando unit of the militant group Hizbullah. It came just days after an apparent Israeli drone strike in Beirut killed Saleh al-Arouri, one of Hamas’s top leaders. As Israel begins to withdraw some troops from a [devastated Gaza](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/12/14/israels-current-large-scale-operation-is-the-last-one-in-gaza), the strikes in Lebanon are fuelling fears that it will shift focus and expand the fighting on its northern front. Until now, it has been cautious about that. But American officials are increasingly worried that Binyamin Netanyahu’s prudence will not last.

## Trump’s immunity claim in court

On Tuesday Donald Trump’s lawyers will try to persuade a court in Washington, DC, to toss out the former president’s election-stealing lawsuit. Ex-presidents cannot be sued in civil court for actions they undertook in office related to their official duties. Mr Trump wants this “absolute immunity” extended to the criminal realm. Without such broad protection, Mr Trump’s lawyers insist, “politically motivated prosecutions” will haunt future presidents. The prosecutor, Jack Smith, counters that overturning election results was far from an official duty. 

Mr Smith knew that the challenge was coming. In December he asked the Supreme Court to [bypass](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/12/the-supreme-court-will-decide-how-quickly-donald-trump-is-prosecuted) the normal appeals process and take it up directly. His request was declined, but the matter will likely land back in the justices’ lap within weeks. The trial, scheduled to begin on March 4th, is [one of five](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/09/06/a-primer-on-trumps-criminal-trials) Mr Trump is due to face in 2024. Any delays could prevent voters from learning the verdicts before election day.

## Bullet-proof energy markets

America’s Energy Information Administration releases its twice-yearly forecast on energy markets on Tuesday. The prospects seem bleak. In the Red Sea America is weighing an offensive against the Houthis, a Yemeni militant group that routinely attacks ships in a conduit that carries 8-10% of the world’s seaborne oil and gas. Growing tension in the Middle East threatens to draw Gulf states into Israel’s war against Hamas. Meanwhile Russia continues to pound Ukraine, suggesting no end to the Western sanctions that are starting to cripple its gas projects. Any escalation in the Black Sea could hamper more oil shipments, too.

But the EIA will probably stay calm. After years of high prices, oil producers outside the Gulf have cranked up output, and the market is in [surplus](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/01/04/three-surprises-that-could-inflame-commodity-markets-in-2024). Europe is flush with gas, partly because of stockpiling. And demand for both oil and gas looks likely to remain subdued. It will take a lot to truly disrupt energy markets in 2024.

## Mexico’s economic outlook favours the ruling party

Official data due on Tuesday are likely to show that Mexico finished 2023 with annual inflation at around 4.5% (and 5.2% for “core” inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices). December will probably have been the second consecutive month in which inflation rose, having fallen since the third quarter of 2022. The central bank now does not expect to hit its target of 3% until 2025. Despite that, Mexico’s historically lacklustre economy is doing fairly well: GDP growth in 2023 is projected to have exceeded 3%.

Consumption is strong thanks to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador raising the minimum wage and increasing social handouts and public investment. Circumstances have been serendipitous, too. Many companies are looking to Mexico to avoid tensions between China and America. That said, investors are deterred by Mr López Obrador’s capriciousness. [Claudia Sheinbaum](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/mexico-will-elect-its-first-female-president)—the former Mexico City mayor expected to win June’s presidential election, also from the ruling party—may prove more business-friendly.

## New tech unveiled in Las Vegas

On Tuesday up to 130,000 people will descend on Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronic Show. The annual tech fair will attract representatives from three-fifths of the Fortune Global 500’s companies, as some 4,000 exhibitors display their newest devices, from games consoles to laptops. Over time the shindig has focused increasingly on cars and mobility. This year Honda, a Japanese carmaker, will show off its foldable electric scooter, and the event will also feature a race among [self-driving cars](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/self-driving-cars-are-slowly-moving-forward). Expect plenty of companies to talk up new artificial-intelligence features, too. Microsoft will show off its new keyboard button, which calls up Copilot, its AI assistant.

Behind the scenes, though, consumer tech is struggling amid fears of a looming economic slowdown. Smartphone sales are thought to have fallen by 3.5% in 2023, with shipments of televisions and laptops faring even worse. Exhibitors will be hoping that 2024 brings more joy.
