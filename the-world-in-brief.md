John Eastman, a lawyer [indicted](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/15/donald-trumps-racketeering-indictment-is-the-most-sweeping-yet) alongside <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in <strong>Georgia</strong>, surrendered to authorities. Of the 18 co-defendants in the sweeping racketeering case, he was one of the first to turn himself in. He has denied the charges. Mr Trump has said he will surrender to authorities in Georgia on Thursday. Mark Meadows, Mr Trump’s former chief of staff and co-defendant [charged with racketeering](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/15/donald-trumps-racketeering-indictment-is-the-most-sweeping-yet), asked a federal court to block his arrest if he does not hand himself over to a state court in Georgia. Mr Meadows is seeking to move his case to federal court. Both deny wrongdoing.

## Donald Trump declines to debate

When the first debate among contenders for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination takes place in Wisconsin on Wednesday evening, the front-runner will be missing. Donald Trump, who is polling 37 percentage points ahead of his closest rival Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, says “the public knows who I am”. 

Eight of Mr Trump’s rivals will be hoping to win a measure of fame on the debate stage. Hot topics will probably include abortion and America’s support for Ukraine. Yet, even in absentia, Mr Trump may steal the limelight. The <em>New York Times</em> reports that he has recorded an interview with Tucker Carlson, a tub-thumping former Fox News host, which will be released just as the debate airs. On the following day Mr Trump can expect more notoriety when he is [arraigned in Georgia](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/15/donald-trumps-racketeering-indictment-is-the-most-sweeping-yet) on charges that he sought to overturn the state’s vote for Joe Biden in the presidential election in 2020. Georgia, not Wisconsin, will be on voters’ minds. 

## Russia’s struggling economy

On Wednesday Russia will publish industrial-production figures for July. Economists expect an increase of 5% compared with a year before, which would be the fifth consecutive monthly rise. 

The trend suggests that Russian manufacturers are adapting to the West’s sanctions and industrialists are finding alternative ways to source the components they need to keep producing goods for both Russia’s military and civilian economies. German exports to Russia’s friendlier neighbours in Central Asia, for example, have shot up suspiciously. 

However, the recovery in imports and a slump in the value of exports have contributed to a decline in the value of the [rouble](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/14/russia-will-struggle-to-cope-with-a-sinking-rouble), which briefly dropped below one American cent last week. The central bank raised interest rates by 3.5 percentage points, to 12%, to help prop up the currency. In the longer term, that should dampen Russia’s manufacturing output, at least for the civilian economy.

## Zimbabwe’s general election

When Zimbabweans [head to the polls](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/08/21/miles-tendi-on-the-depressingly-business-as-usual-feel-to-zimbabwes-election) on Wednesday they will do so in a despondent mood. Nearly three-quarters of people in the southern African country think it is going in the wrong direction, public-opinion surveys suggest. Little wonder: the annual rate of inflation hit 175.8% in June, the highest in nearly two and a half years. Millions have emigrated. 

In theory poor economic conditions should spell doom for President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front. But in Zimbabwe voters’ views do not always translate into election results. ZANU PF has a history of rigging elections. Nelson Chamisa, leader of the main opposition party, Citizens Coalition for Change, claims that chicanery is once again rife. He is likely to contest the result. 

If there is credible evidence of rigging, it will be hard for Zimbabwe to end its pariah status in the eyes of Western governments. As a result it will only deepen its ties with Russia and China. 

## Projecting power in the South China Sea

Three big warships—from America, Australia and Japan—are due to assemble this week, possibly as early as Wednesday, for exercises in the South China Sea. The allied flotilla will carry helicopters and fighter planes. The joint exercises are meant to show off allied naval force in the face of Chinese power farther north, in the waters around Taiwan, which China [claims as its own](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/10/how-the-nine-dash-line-fuels-tensions-in-the-south-china-sea). 

They will take place near the Philippines, which is already in a maritime dispute with China. [A rotting warship](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/08/10/a-rotting-warship-becomes-a-flashpoint-for-sino-american-rivalry), deliberately run aground in 1999 around 200km from Palawan, a Philippine island, serves as a holdout against Chinese expansion, asserting a claim to parts of the South China Sea. The most harmful weapons used so far have been blinding laser beams and bruising water cannon, wielded by China. The Philippines has no aircraft-carriers, so its government’s alliances with America, Australia and Japan help to keep the dispute’s intensity low. China has to think twice about clashing with its small neighbours when they have powerful friends. 

## India’s nail-biting moonshot

India aims to land [the first spacecraft](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/08/16/a-pair-of-indian-and-russian-probes-approach-the-moon) near the Moon’s shadowy south pole on Wednesday, days after a Russian mission, <em>Luna 25</em>, [crashed nearby](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/08/20/russias-bid-to-return-to-the-moon-comes-to-an-ignominious-end). An earlier attempt by India in September 2019 failed, as did those by Israel, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. The Indian Space Research Organisation’s lander is designed to disgorge a rover to study, among other things, ice that might one day be tapped to produce drinking water, oxygen and hydrogen fuel. India’s mission, <em>Chandrayaan-3</em>, cost less than it did to produce “Gravity”, a Hollywood space thriller from 2013. A successful touchdown will boost investment in India’s space industry, as well as national pride.

It will also make India just the fourth country, after America, the Soviet Union and China, to have landed on the Moon. But India’s is not the last such mission: Japan launches its own on August 26th, and more American missions will follow. The rush to return to the Moon has only just begun.
