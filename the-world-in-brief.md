## The world in brief 2023-05-26

<strong>Ron DeSantis’s</strong> [presidential-campaign launch](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/24/ron-desantis-has-little-chance-of-beating-donald-trump) on Twitter was marred by technical glitches, delaying it by nearly half an hour, during which hundreds of thousands of users tuned out of the audio broadcast. Mr DeSantis was forced to deliver a truncated version of his stump speech, in which he promised to lead a “great American comeback”. In a later interview with Fox News, Mr DeSantis said as president he would ensure that “woke ideology ends up in the dustbin of history”. 

<strong>Iran</strong> said that it had successfully test-launched a 2,000km-range ballistic missile. The country maintains that its missile programme, one of the biggest in the Middle East, is “defensive”. This weapon, however, will be capable of reaching Israel, a long-time foe. On Tuesday the chief of Israel’s armed forces warned of “action” over Iran’s nuclear developments.

<strong>Russia </strong>and <strong>Belarus</strong> signed a deal which would allow Russia to deploy [tactical nuclear missiles](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/perils-grow-as-america-and-russia-stop-sharing-data-on-nukes) on Belarusian territory. Both countries framed the decision as a defensive one, with Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, calling it a response to the “sharp escalation of threats” from the West. Control of the weapons will remain with Moscow.

<strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, Ukraine’s president, said that Russia launched 36 Iranian drones towards Ukraine overnight. Mr Zelensky warned Iran against supplying more drones to Russia, saying that doing so could land them on “the dark side of history”. Meanwhile the head of the [Wagner Group](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/05/11/why-the-boss-of-wagner-group-is-feuding-with-russias-military-leaders), a mercenary organisation, announced that his troops would transfer their positions in <strong>Bakhmut</strong> to the Russian military.

<strong>America’s Supreme Court</strong> limited the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate water pollution under the Clean Water Act. The court ruled that the agency’s power does not apply to some wetlands. It is the second time the court has restricted [the EPA’s authority](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/30/the-supreme-court-throttles-joe-bidens-climate-agenda) in less than a year, having previously curtailed its ability to curb emissions from power plants.

<strong>Britain </strong>announced record [net migration figures](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/05/25/british-voters-want-more-immigrants-but-less-immigration), with 606,000 people added to the country’s population in 2022. One-off factors such as an influx of [refugees from Ukraine](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2023/02/22/ukrainian-refugees-remain-in-limbo) and immigrants from Hong Kong (a combined total of 160,000) contributed to the increase. Asylum seekers were also included for the first time. Almost 40% of migrants came as students, although the total share of non-EU student immigration fell in 2022.

An iconic cotton tree in [Freetown](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/10/15/spellbinding-sierra-leone-has-plenty-to-offer), <strong>Sierra Leone’s</strong> capital, was knocked down by heavy winds. The enormous tree—which is also depicted on the country’s banknotes—was considered a symbol of liberty. The freed American slaves who founded the country are believed to have huddled under its branches upon arrival to their new home. The country’s president declared it a “great loss to the nation”.

<strong>Figure of the day: </strong>$2trn, the amount that governments spent on defence in 2022, a 4% increase in real terms over 2021.[ Read the full story. ](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/23/the-cost-of-the-global-arms-race)

## Happy birthday GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation, [Europe’s landmark privacy law](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2018/04/05/europes-tough-new-data-protection-law), turns five on Thursday. Controversial from its inception, it has nevertheless become a global standard. About 160 countries have included the GDPR’s main principles in their privacy legislation (such as consent and the right to access personal information). Big companies such as Microsoft apply those rules worldwide. More than 1,700 enforcement actions have been taken and fines of €2.7bn ($2.9bn) levied.

Still, privacy advocates complain about weak enforcement, particularly in Ireland, where many American big-tech firms have their European base (although regulators there fined Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, a record €1.2bn on Monday). Others argue that the EU is weakening the [GDPR](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/05/04/why-oligarchs-love-european-data-protection-laws) by passing one digital law after another: the Digital Markets and Digital Services Act, for example, which both regulate big online platforms. In its effort to become the world’s digital super-regulator, the EU may be spreading itself too thinly—making enforcement more patchy.

## Britain’s toxic immigration figures

Britain announced a record level of net [immigration](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/07/britain-has-entered-a-third-phase-of-post-war-immigration) on Thursday, with 606,000 people arriving in the year ending 2022. A more liberal regime for students and skilled workers, along with one-off factors such as an influx of [refugees from Ukraine](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2023/02/22/ukrainian-refugees-remain-in-limbo) and immigrants from Hong Kong (a total of 160,000), were the main reasons for the increase. For the first time asylum seekers were included in the figures too. Immigration has been a toxic issue in Britain for over a decade, with both the Conservative and Labour parties battling to appear tough on the topic. The latest figures continue the sharp trend upwards since Britain left the EU.  
  
[Rishi Sunak](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/04/13/rishi-sunak-a-very-tory-kind-of-technocrat), the Conservative prime minister, pledged to bring immigration down; these latest figures will only add to frustration with his government on the right wing of his party. Mr Sunak has already promised to tighten rules on student visas, after a dramatic increase in the number of postgraduate students bringing their families to Britain. 

## George Floyd, three years on

George Floyd’s murder, three years ago on Thursday, sparked [fierce protests](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/05/29/twelve-months-of-protests) worldwide. For much of America’s left, too little has changed since. Police killed more people in 2022 than in 2020; Congress has failed to pass significant federal police reform; local changes, they argue, have too often been cosmetic. The right, by contrast, says that progressives’ hostility towards the police has led directly to a rise in violent crime and public disorder.

What is beyond dispute is that [police departments](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/15/america-should-reform-its-police-forces-not-defund-them) across the country face officer shortages, with many recently retiring. Those remaining must work longer hours with less supervision, leaving them with less time for the laborious but essential investigative work required to solve serious crimes. Murder-clearance rates are at a historic low; in many cities, most homicides go unsolved. That has given crime a political salience it has not had in years. Expect Republicans to use every opportunity to bash Democrats for being soft on crime in next year’s election campaigns.

## The dollar-store boom

Hard times for consumers often mean boom times for cheap retailers. That helps explain why the share price of Dollar Tree, an American purveyor of [cut-price miscellanea](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/01/25/the-profitable-business-of-selling-to-the-hard-up), is up by nearly 50% from its level two years ago. Analysts expect the company will announce a healthy first-quarter sales growth year on year of 5.7% on Thursday. 

It is not an outlier. On May 18th [Walmart](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/05/02/the-business-trend-that-unites-walmart-and-tiffany-and-co), another wallet-friendly chain, reported a growth rate of 7.6% in the first quarter, beating expectations. Analysts are likewise anticipating juicy growth from Dollar General, Dollar Tree’s arch-rival, when it reports its latest quarterly results on June 1st. 

Both Dollar Tree and Dollar General are ramping up store openings this year, signalling their confidence in continued growth. But that suggests more bad news for the health of American consumers: between 2008 and 2020 dollar stores were the fastest-growing retailers of food in the country by share of household spending, offering low prices but high calories and poor nutrition. 

## A new Photography Centre at the V&amp;A

On Thursday the Victoria and Albert Museum in London will open its brand new [Photography](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/11/21/what-to-read-to-become-a-better-photographer) Centre. Spanning seven galleries, including previously closed-off rooms, it will be the largest space in Britain for a permanent photography collection. Tristram Hunt, the V&amp;A’s director, calls it a “museum with a museum”. 

The first iteration of the Photography Centre opened in 2018, after the V&amp;A bought the Royal Photographic Society’s entire collection of 270,000 images. Now a new suite of galleries completes the vision, displaying a range of works from the origins of the discipline to the modern day. 

The V&amp;A will also provide space for contemporary work and special commissions. Opening installations feature Gauri Gill’s image series of temporary architecture on the outskirts of Delhi, and Jake Elwes’s “deepfake drag cabaret” video installation, which explores ethical problems in artificial intelligence.
