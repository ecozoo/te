## The world in brief 2023-05-25

<strong>Ron DeSantis’s</strong> [presidential-campaign launch](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/24/ron-desantis-has-little-chance-of-beating-donald-trump) on Twitter was marred by technical glitches, delaying it by nearly half an hour, during which hundreds of thousands of users tuned out of the audio broadcast. The moderator, in a feeble attempt at spin, joked that they were “breaking the internet”. In fact Twitter’s fumbling of the event was nothing short of an embarrassment for Mr DeSantis and Elon Musk.

Denis Kapustin, the head of a Russian paramilitary group that [raided](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/05/23/who-are-the-pro-ukrainian-militias-raiding-russias-belgorod-region) <strong>Belgorod</strong>, the Russian region bordering Ukraine, promised more such incursions soon. Speaking to media in Ukraine, Mr Kapustin described himself as the leader of the Russian Volunteer Corps, a group that opposes Vladimir Putin. He said Ukraine encouraged the attack but did not provide weapons.

Fitch warned that America’s perfect <strong>credit rating</strong> could be downgraded, should the country fail to [raise its debt ceiling](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/22/what-happens-if-america-defaults-on-its-debt) before June 1st. The credit-ratings agency placed America on a “rating watch negative” list because of “increased political partisanship” hindering talks to resolve the looming fiscal crisis. President Joe Biden’s administration insisted that “a bipartisan, reasonable agreement” was possible.

<strong>Canada </strong>and <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> agreed to restore diplomatic ties, ending a five-year feud. Both countries said they would appoint new ambassadors and build a relationship based on common interests. Their relationship had collapsed [in 2018](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/08/09/saudi-arabia-picks-a-pointless-fight-with-canada) after Canadian officials criticised Saudi Arabia’s human-rights record. The kingdom responded by freezing all new trade and investment transactions with Canada. 

At a UN-hosted conference in New York, several countries pledged to provide aid worth $2.4bn to prevent a <strong>famine</strong> in the <strong>Horn of Africa</strong>, which is experiencing its [worst drought](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/19/somalia-is-on-the-brink-of-famine) in 40 years. Antonio Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, described the situation as “crisis on top of crises”. The sum is considerably less than the $7bn the UN says is needed.

<strong>Israel’s parliament</strong> voted through a 1trn-shekel ($269bn) spending package after [Binyamin Netanyahu](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/16/will-bibi-break-israel), the prime minister, made concessions to previously resistant far-right factions within his coalition. The final deal included funding for settler developments in the occupied West Bank, as well as resources for the ultra-orthodox education system. Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, called it the “most destructive budget in the country’s history”.

<strong>Tina Turner</strong>—the “queen of rock’n’roll”—died at home in Switzerland, aged 83. Known for her husky voice, she found early success in an R&amp;B musical duo with her abusive husband, Ike, whom she divorced in 1976. Years later came her reinvention as a stomping, stadium-filling solo act. She won 12 Grammys.

<strong>Figure of the day: </strong>60,000, the number of people seeking asylum that have arrived in New York since last spring. [Read the full story. ](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/18/it-turns-out-that-democrats-bus-migrants-too)

## Ron DeSantis runs

On Wednesday Ron DeSantis will officially declare his bid for America’s presidency—during a discussion with Elon Musk on Twitter, according to news reports. Mr DeSantis is the most formidable Republican challenger to Donald Trump, but he has lost momentum since [cruising to re-election](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/09/the-rise-of-ron-desanctimonious) as Florida’s governor last year. A blunder over the Ukraine war (he called it a [“territorial dispute”](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/16/ron-desantis-emboldens-vladimir-putin)), his [feud with Disney](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/what-ron-desantiss-spat-with-disney-says-about-american-politics/21808962) and his decision to enact a [ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/15/ron-desantiss-six-week-abortion-ban-brings-risks-to-women) have [raised doubts](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/30/ron-desantiss-lurch-in-florida-hurts-his-presidential-chances) about his political acumen.

An average of recent polls of Republican voters suggests that they prefer the former president to Mr DeSantis by 56% to 21%. The party’s convention in July 2024, where the nominee will be crowned, is still about 60 weeks from now. But even primary-race polls taken this early tend to predict later performance. Mr DeSantis’s chances of reaching the general election are not zero, but they are small.

## Lukashenko shakes off health rumours

President Vladimir Putin met [Alexander Lukashenko](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/11/05/in-belarus-neither-dictator-nor-protesters-are-backing-down), his Belarusian counterpart, in Moscow on Wednesday. That is not unusual: the two leaders meet frequently. But onlookers might have been paying extra attention to Mr Lukashanko’s demeanour amid rumours that his health has deteriorated. The dictator disappeared from public view for a week this month. Doctors suspected that the 68-year-old had viral heart inflammation, independent Belarusian media reported. That is treatable. Still, speculation is rife about what will happen if he dies soon.

Mr Lukashenko, who has governed Belarus since 1994, has named no successor. The country’s exiled opposition hopes his death will bring about a democratic opening. But many worry that Belarusians—thousands of whom were jailed and tortured for [protesting](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/11/05/in-belarus-neither-dictator-nor-protesters-are-backing-down) against the rigging of elections in 2020—will be too afraid to rise up again in defence of democracy should Mr Lukashenko die. In addition, Russian security forces might well intervene to ensure that the next president is not someone with Ukraine-like ideas about freeing Belarus from [the Kremlin’s influence](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/03/17/how-belaruss-role-in-the-invasion-of-ukraine-could-grow). 

## Nvidia capitalises on AI hype

Nvidia, the world’s sixth-most-valuable listed company, reports earnings on Wednesday. It is expected to be a celebratory affair. The chipmaker has been the top performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index of listed firms in 2023, doubling in value since the start of year. The success of ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, an American startup, has boosted bullish investor sentiment around artificial intelligence. That has caused demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units, the specialised chips used to train big AI models, to surge. 

Nvidia’s role as the [“infrastructure” provider](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2021/08/01/will-nvidias-huge-bet-on-artificial-intelligence-chips-pay-off) for AI makes it well positioned to turn a profit. It produces custom software to run on its chips that developers worldwide have grown accustomed to, helping to lock in customers. And the firm is continuing to innovate. In March it revealed software that will make lithography—the process of printing a chip’s design onto a chip wafer—far more efficient. That should give investors yet more reasons to be cheerful.

## Go First, a struggling Indian airline

Aviation in [India](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade) is flying high, but with some turbulence. On April 30th domestic airlines carried more than 450,000 people, a new daily record. Yet just a few days later Go First, a budget airline and India’s fourth-largest carrier, filed for bankruptcy. It blamed “defective and failing engines” made by Pratt &amp; Whitney, an American firm, for grounding half of its fleet and costing it 108bn rupees ($1.3bn). Pratt &amp; Whitney denies the allegations.

The insolvency application forced Go First to suspend its flights. The company was hoping to resume them on Wednesday, but that has since been pushed back. On Monday an appeals court helped Go First by preventing aircraft lessors from taking back planes leased to the airline. But pilots and cabin crew are getting restless as [Air India](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/12/a-humiliating-incident-on-an-air-india-flight-triggers-outrage) and IndiGo, the market leaders, look to recruit. In truth, Go First may struggle to take off again. 

## Spotting gravitational waves

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory—the world’s most sensitive device for spotting gravitational waves—starts up again on Wednesday after a three-year hiatus for upgrades.

LIGO is [designed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/06/01/gravity-wave-detectors-offer-a-new-way-to-look-at-the-universe) to detect subtle ripples in space and time radiated out by cataclysmic cosmic events like colliding black holes and supernovae. The existence of these cosmic wiggles was predicted, over a century ago, by the mathematics of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But it was only confirmed when LIGO [observed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/02/13/gravitational-waves-have-been-detected-for-the-first-time) the waves in 2015. The upgrades to LIGO’s instruments have resulted in more sensitive detectors, capable of observing far fainter gravitational-wave events than before.

LIGO consists of two American detectors in the states of Louisiana and Washington. It will be joined on this run by Virgo and KAGRA, LIGO’s European and Japanese equivalents. Astrophysicists hope that the joint sensitivity of these observatories will be enough to detect waves from the universe’s earliest origins.
