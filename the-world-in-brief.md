## The world in brief 2023-05-21

<strong>Volodymyr Zelensky </strong>met the leaders of <strong>G7</strong>, a club of rich democracies, on the final day of their summit in Japan. A day earlier Ukraine’s president spoke with Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, for the first time since the Russian invasion. Mr Zelensky is hoping to sway neutral countries like India and Brazil. India is a major importer of sanctioned Russian oil. Earlier President Joe Biden said that America would allow Ukraine’s pilots to train on [F-16 fighter jets](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/26/the-west-should-supply-ukraine-with-f-16s).

Mr Zelensky said that <strong>Bakhmut</strong>, in eastern Ukraine, had been reduced to “just drones and a lot of dead Russians” but did not confirm that Russians had captured the town. President Vladimir Putin had previously congratulated his forces for doing so. Though it has limited strategic value, Bakhmut has taken on totemic significance—Russia has been trying to [take it](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/03/russia-could-take-bakhmut-within-weeks) for almost a year.

The leaders of the <strong>G7 </strong>condemned <strong>China’s </strong>“economic coercion” and “militarisation activities” in the [South China Sea](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/10/how-the-nine-dash-line-fuels-tensions-in-the-south-china-sea). They agreed to found a new body to counter hostile economic actions, inspired no doubt by China’s tendency to weaponise trade dependence. Meanwhile Tsai Ing-wen, president of Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province, told reporters in Taipei that “war is not an option”.

Intermediaries from America and Saudi Arabia negotiated a seven-day ceasefire between rival factions in <strong>Sudan</strong>. The Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces, who [have been fighting](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-peacemaking-in-sudan) over control of the country, are due to lay down arms on Monday evening. Several previous ceasefires have been struck in the conflict, which has raged for over a month. None have stuck.

<strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, Florida’s governor, asked for the disqualification of the federal judge overseeing a lawsuit brought against him by <strong>Disney</strong>. The judge, Mark Walker, once said that Florida had targeted Disney, according to Mr DeSantis’s lawyers. The Republican presidential contender is embroiled in a [long-running feud](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/30/ron-desantiss-lurch-in-florida-hurts-his-presidential-chances) with the company after its previous boss criticised a Floridian bill restricting the discussion of sexuality in schools.

<strong>Greece</strong> announced the recovery of 351 looted <strong>artefacts</strong>, including a second-century bronze statue of Alexander the Great, after a 17-year legal battle with a company run by a British antique dealer. Separately, Greece wants the return of the Parthenon (or Elgin) Marbles from the British Museum. Campaigns for the return of [treasures](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/01/egyptians-want-britain-to-return-the-rosetta-stone) to their countries of origin have been gathering strength—but sometimes encountering [complications](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/a-ruling-over-ownership-of-the-benin-bronzes-may-delay-their-return).

Fellow authors paid tribute to <strong>Martin Amis</strong>, the British writer of [darkly comic novels](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/11/07/martin-amiss-new-book-mixes-autofiction-and-writing-advice) including “Money” and “London Fields”, whose death, at the age of 73, was announced on Saturday. “His friends will miss him terribly,” Sir Salman Rushdie told the <em>New Yorker</em>. “But we have the shelf.”

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>décroissance</em>, or “de-growth” in French. The aim of some left-leaning Europeans, who would like to deliberately shrink the economy in the hope of avoiding ecological and societal collapse.

<em><strong>Correction:</strong> We previously stated that the ceasefire in Sudan was scheduled to begin on Monday morning. It will in fact start on Monday evening. Sorry.</em>

## Economic woes divide Greek voters

When Greeks finish voting on Sunday New Democracy, the ruling centre-right party, is expected to come first. But it will almost certainly fail to win an outright majority. The country would then head for another election in July. Both Syriza and Pasok, left-wing parties that could help ND form a majority coalition, have ruled out the possibility of joining such a government. 

Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the technocratic prime minister, who is a member of one of Greece’s oldest political dynasties, has overseen an economic revival since taking office in 2019. The economy is now more than 6% larger in real terms than before the pandemic, helped by strong growth in exports and foreign investment. 

But many ordinary Greeks are missing out on the benefits of the recovery. Pensions have barely risen and the unemployment rate is in double digits. One in three families risks falling into poverty, according to the EU’s statistics agency, far above the average for the bloc. ND must do more to woo voters in the summer.

## Insects could help turn beer waste into beef

Despite <em>The Economist’</em>s [best](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2021/09/28/feeding-9bn-people-will-mean-reimagining-the-edible-world) efforts, [eating insects](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/films/2022/01/25/the-future-of-food) has not yet caught on among humans. Luckily, livestock are less fussy. Insects are a nutritious source of animal feed. Of course, insects also need to eat. Most insect-rearing has thus far relied on surplus chicken feed. But if insect-reared meat is to take off, new sources will be needed. A study published in <em>Applied Entomology</em>, a journal, proposes feeding them the beer industry’s waste products.

Around 185bn litres of beer are consumed worldwide each year. Each litre produces between three and ten litres of wastewater full of barley and yeast, a mix rich in protein but deficient in carbohydrates. Because insects in the wild typically rely on carbohydrates, it was unclear if they would take to the waste. But researchers found that they ate it happily. Slaughterhouses and sugar-beet could also provide sources of plentiful, protein-rich waste for insects to feast on. 

## Private astronauts set off for the ISS

If all goes to plan—never a given in astronautics—a launch from Florida to the International Space Station on Sunday will mark the next step in the privatisation of crewed spaceflight. The mission is operated by Axiom, a company using a Dragon capsule spacecraft (made and launched by [SpaceX](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/04/20/despite-an-explosion-elon-musk-is-closer-to-his-new-space-age)) to fly private passengers to the ISS and put them to work on experiments Axiom is carrying out there for other companies. 

This, Axiom’s second mission, is not only flying deep-pocketed punters. The four-person crew includes two Saudi Arabian “mission specialists”, paid for by the Saudi Space Commission. Astronauts from various other countries (including Turkey and the UAE) are booked on later flights, with Axiom positioning its services as a chance for governments to run their own space programs even if they cannot afford to develop the infrastructure themselves. And once the ISS reaches the end of its life, some time after 2028, Axiom and other companies have plans for fully commercial space stations to take its place.

## The best of Arabic fiction

An old Arabic saying goes, “Cairo writes, Beirut publishes, Baghdad reads.” But these days the richer Gulf countries are the ones burnishing their cultural bona fides. [Sharjah International Book Fair](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/07/06/the-unlikely-rise-of-book-fairs-in-the-gulf) in the United Arab Emirates attracts more than 2m visitors a year. And on Sunday the winners of the International Prize for Arabic Fiction will be announced in the country’s capital, Abu Dhabi.

This year’s contenders include “Concerto Qurina Eduardo”, a coming-of-age tale set in Libya by Najwa Binshatwan, as well as “The Stone of Happiness”, about a photographer’s struggles to capture Iraq ravaged by war, by Azher Jirjees. 

The award, launched in 2007 with the help of Britain’s Booker Prize, has helped promote regional writers. But it has also overlooked women—only two have ever won. And its relevance is perhaps waning, as English threatens [Arabic in the Gulf](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/29/losing-the-language-of-the-koran). A survey of young Gulf Arabs from 2017 found that most use English more regularly than Arabic. Indeed, the winner of the IPAF will receive a fully funded translation into English. 

## Weekend profile: Guillermo Lasso, Ecuador’s beleaguered president

For years Ecuador avoided the troubles that have plagued its neighbours in Latin America. The country hasn’t experienced military rule since 1979 nor did it suffer much from violence. But this exceptionalism is now in danger. A crime wave related to drug-trafficking has seen the country’s homicide rate race past those of Colombia and Mexico, to more than 25 per 100,000 people. The country’s politics is in turmoil as well. On Wednesday Guillermo Lasso, the conservative president, used a previously untried constitutional rule known as <em>muerte cruzada</em> (“mutual death”) to [dissolve the parliament](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/05/18/ecuadors-president-dissolves-congress-to-avoid-impeachment) after it looked poised to impeach him on flimsy charges of embezzlement. Snap presidential and parliamentary elections will follow within 97 days. 

Mr Lasso was elected on a campaign to ensure political stability. The 67-year-old’s conservatism was shaped by his background. He grew up in a middle-class family in Guayaquil, a business hub on Ecuador’s Pacific Coast. He did not complete a university degree, but that did not stop him from climbing to the top of Ecuador’s financial elite, earning a fortune in banking.

Later he entered local politics, overseeing the construction of a giant bus terminal in his hometown. Such successes propelled him into the national arena. But it took years for a breakthrough. In 2013 Mr Lasso lost the presidential election to Rafael Correa, the populist firebrand who led Ecuador from 2007 to 2017. He lost to Mr Correa’s proxy in 2017.

After finally winning the presidency in 2021, Mr Lasso’s tenure started well. He led a successful covid-19 vaccine drive, inoculating half of the Ecuadorean population in just 100 days. And the economy has been buoyant. Last year GDP grew by 3%, faster than the regional average. But surging drug-related violence and prison riots have hurt Mr Lasso’s reputation. His inexperienced team failed to build a coalition to prevent the opposition Citizens’ Revolution, led by Mr Correa, from controlling parliament. That allowed Citizens’ Revolution to launch impeachment proceedings.

Mr Lasso’s dissolution of parliament is not popular. The opposition has claimed it is illegal; protests are a possibility. But by guaranteeing elections relatively soon, Mr Lasso may ensure Ecuador retains some exceptionalism by avoiding the political violence that has beset neighbouring Peru.
