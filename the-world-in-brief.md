Efforts to rescue those endangered by [the destruction](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-65816109) of the <strong>Kakhovka dam</strong>, located in a Russian-controlled area of south-east Ukraine, continued. Ukrainian officials reported that 29 towns and villages had been flooded, leaving people stranded on their rooftops and without drinking water. Authorities say at least 40,000 people must be evacuated. Russia and Ukraine each blame the other for the blast. Though it is too early to assess the long-term damage, officials are concerned about homelessness, crop failure, energy shortages and displaced landmines. At least three people have died, according to local media.

Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said her country’s forces advanced across various sections of the frontline near <strong>Bakhmut</strong>, an eastern town that Russia captured at great cost in May. Ms Maliar said Bakhmut “remains the epicentre of hostilities”. In recent days Ukrainian troops have been [testing Russian defences](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/06/07/ukraines-counter-offensive-is-gathering-pace) across most of the 1,000km front.

Millions of Americans were urged to stay indoors as [thick smoke](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/07/smoke-blackens-the-air-in-americas-north-east) from <strong>wildfires</strong> in Canada drifted farther down <strong>America’s east coast</strong>. Several big theatre performances and baseball games were cancelled as the New York City region recorded its worst-ever air quality. Readings in Toronto, Canada and Syracuse, in upstate New York, were similarly high-risk. Flights bound for New York City-area airports were temporarily grounded.

Republican leaders in <strong>America’s House of Representatives</strong> cancelled this week’s votes after a two-day standoff with the Freedom Caucus, a group on the party’s right wing. The caucus paralysed the House, refusing to cede control of the floor in protest at the [debt-ceiling deal](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/01/america-avoids-financial-armageddon-but-stays-in-fiscal-hell) that Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, struck with President Joe Biden.

Israeli troops fired live rounds at [Palestinians](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/the-palestinians-need-new-leaders) who threw stones, a witness told Reuters. Palestine’s health ministry said that at least six people went to hospital, three with gunshot wounds.

<strong>Japan’s GDP </strong>increased by 2.7% year on year in the first quarter of 2023, a much higher rate than the 1.6% analysts had estimated.

## Japan’s remarkable economic recovery

The Japanese economy seems to have come out swinging since covid-19. The country’s GDP data for the first quarter of 2023, released on Thursday, showed an expansion of 2.7% year on year, far exceeding analyst estimates of 1.6%. Productivity has been boosted by companies buying equipment in response to pandemic-induced labour shortages; capital expenditure in the first quarter rose by 11%, the fastest gain since 2015. Bursts in consumption and tourism have also aided growth. 

Yet a sluggish world economy continues to hurt Japan by weakening demand for its manufactured goods. In particular, slow growth in China, Japan’s biggest trading partner, is holding back exports. Though inflation has hit a four-decade high, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) believes it will come down soon, which is why Japan is currently keeping [interest rates](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/04/how-japanese-policymakers-ended-up-in-a-very-deep-hole) far lower than elsewhere. The BoJ hopes that will keep fueling the economic recovery. But Japan may not be able to buck global growth trends for much longer.

## Biden and Sunak are not quite in lockstep

Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, will meet Joe Biden, America’s president, in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Prospects for an Anglo-American trade deal—once touted as a benefit of Brexit—are slim. Instead Mr Sunak will seek to solve a looming problem: the risks to British supply chains from Mr Biden’s $369bn green-subsidies package in his Inflation Reduction Act. (Mr Sunak has said that “subsidy races” are not the way to achieve climate goals.)

Mr Sunak also wants Britain to have a greater role in regulating artificial intelligence. He is hoping for a lighter-touch regime than the one developed by the EU, with the aim of luring investment. The two men will also discuss Ukraine.

The transatlantic “special relationship” deteriorated under Boris Johnson, a former prime minister, but Mr Sunak has revived it somewhat—in large part because he agreed to a [new settlement](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/03/22/british-mps-approve-rishi-sunaks-northern-irish-deal-with-the-eu) between Northern Ireland and the EU, a cause close to Mr Biden’s heart.

## The EU’s difficult migration discussions

Ever since Europe’s migrant crisis in 2015 and 2016, the bloc has needed a collective system to deal with refugees. All efforts to create one have [failed](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/17/a-new-migration-crisis-is-brewing-in-europe). On Thursday, however, the justice and home affairs ministers of EU countries will meet to try to agree on two of the pieces such a system would require: standard rules for processing applications for asylum, and a mechanism for ensuring applications are shared more evenly among member countries.

Both are tricky. Countries at the EU’s southern edge, such as Greece and Italy, get far more refugees than others. Those other countries currently agree only to a weak “solidarity mechanism”, which offers EU border states little concrete support. These states then often take harsh measures (some of them illegal) to push back or deport migrants, and oppose rules that would limit their freedom to do so. Even if the ministers can agree on a solution, any reforms will have to be approved by the European Parliament.

## Wizz Air’s high hopes

Can Wizz regain its zip? That will be the question on the minds of investors on Thursday, when the Hungarian budget airline—the third biggest low-cost carrier in Europe after Ryanair and Easyjet—reports its annual results. Wizz is still recovering from the [pandemic](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2021/07/06/which-airlines-will-soar-after-the-pandemic), which depressed travel, as well as from the effects of war in Ukraine (the core of its business is in eastern and central Europe). It probably lost money in the year to the end of March.

But Wizz is on course to become profitable again in 2024. Travel-starved passengers will keep demand, and fares, high. Meanwhile, the airline is serving new destinations and finding ways to fill up more seats on its planes.

It is still uncertain whether Wizz will succeed with its ambitious expansion plans. It wants to triple its fleet to some 500 planes by 2030 and perhaps carry 200m passengers a year. If it manages that then zip will turn to zoom.

## Poland’s abortion ban on trial

When one plaintiff lodged her case in 2021 she was 27 years old and ten weeks pregnant. She feared that if there were complications she would not get the care she needed in Poland. Another plaintiff says that if her foetus was defective—no longer grounds for abortion in Poland as of 2021—carrying it to term would be “torture”.

These cases, and six others, will be decided by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on Thursday. All are brought by women who accuse Poland of violating their rights by [tightening abortion laws](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/10/31/polands-abortion-rules-are-now-among-the-strictest-in-any-rich-country). Since January 2021 abortions have only been permitted in Poland in cases of rape or incest, or if the mother’s health is at risk. These are the strictest rules imposed by any rich country.

Doctors have since delayed performing even legal procedures. Women have died as a result. The [underground abortion network](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/02/27/europes-underground-abortion-network) has expanded; many Poles seek abortions abroad or smuggle in pills. The ECHR’s ruling, though non-binding, may highlight how far Poland has diverged from contemporary European norms.
