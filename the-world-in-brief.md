<strong>Russia</strong> launched a wave of air strikes against <strong>Ukraine’s port cities </strong>just hours after the Kremlin pulled out from the agreement that allowed Ukraine to export grain via the Black Sea. Earlier Russia said it would “return” to the [grain deal](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger) if restrictions on its exporting food and fertiliser were eased. It denied that the decision was connected to an attack on the Kerch bridge that links Russia with Crimea. Russia said traffic had resumed on the bridge.

## America shows South Korea its nuclear playbook

Credibility is crucial to America’s extended nuclear deterrent. Not only must the superpower dissuade enemies from trying anything, but it must convince allies that it will respond if they ever do. Fear does the first part. The second is a bit trickier.

Concern from South Korean hawks that America would not risk a North Korean nuclear strike on, say, Seattle to save Seoul have led to ever louder calls for an [indigenous South Korean nuclear-weapons programme](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/19/why-south-korea-is-talking-about-getting-its-own-nukes). America hopes that the first-ever meeting on Tuesday of the two allies’ new Nuclear Consultative Group will quieten them. Though it does not fundamentally change America’s nuclear posture, the NCG provides a forum for the two to engage in “nuclear and strategic planning”. For now, that seems to be enough for Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president. Speaking at South Korea’s Memorial Day on June 6th, he crowed that the two countries’ 70-year-old military partnership had been “upgraded to a nuclear-based alliance”.

## The West takes on Russia’s sanctions-dodging

On Tuesday the Helsinki Commission, an American federal agency, holds a hearing on [Switzerland’s role](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/19/europes-neutral-countries-are-having-to-adapt-to-the-new-world) in helping Russia evade Western sanctions. Switzerland has long had a reputation for stashing away the assets of Russia’s kleptocrats: the HC estimates that Swiss banks hold more than $200bn in Russian cash. And in March four Swiss bankers were convicted in Zurich of failing to carry out full due diligence on transfers made by Sergei Roldugin, a Russian cellist and close confidant of Vladimir Putin. 

But Switzerland is far from alone in frustrating Western efforts to enforce sanctions. The European Union’s latest measures targeted companies which help Russia to circumvent the bloc’s export controls. The entities in question came from countries including China, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. In May Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, criticised India for refining Russian crude oil and shipping it to the West. When it comes to trading with Russia, opportunities for [middlemen](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/20/buyers-of-russian-crude-are-exporting-refined-oil-to-the-west) abound. 

## Main Street thrives, Wall Street suffers

Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, two of America’s largest banks, reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Results suggested that Main Street—small businesses and households—are doing just fine. BofA, a Main Street commercial bank, reported better-than-expected results, with profits increasing by 19% year on year. Its earnings on loans have soared, propped up by higher interest rates. Typically higher rates might also induce a recession, pushing up loan losses. But there is little sign of that yet. Defaults ticked up only a little at Citi, [JPMorgan Chase](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/11/the-last-unfulfilled-dream-of-jamie-dimon-king-of-wall-street) and Wells Fargo, which reported on Friday. 

It is a different story on Wall Street, where higher rates have dried up the flow of initial public offerings and merger deals. Market turbulence can help trading desks—but this, too, was absent in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley’s net profit dropped by 14%. At JPMorgan investment-banking fees and trading revenues both fell on the year. That bodes ill for Goldman Sachs, which reports earnings on Wednesday. 

## America’s securocrats gather in Aspen

Much of America’s national-security establishment takes to the Colorado mountains on Tuesday to reflect on the geopolitical moment. Over the four-day Aspen Security Forum they will have a lot to ponder: the war in Ukraine and the diplomacy that might follow it; the power-struggles in the Kremlin exposed by [Yevgeny Prigozhin’s brief revolt](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/29/the-wagner-mutiny-has-left-vladimir-putin-looking-dangerously-exposed); and the deepening rivalry between [America and China](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/china/2023/01/29/a-new-challenge-to-relations-between-america-and-china) amid efforts to stabilise relations. 

The conference tends to be an all-American talkfest. This time, however, a sizeable international contingent will be in Aspen, emulating the transatlantic feel of the Munich Security Conference. What Americans say and think still matters most but, increasingly, America relies on allies to counterbalance its foes. 

Perhaps the biggest topic is not formally on the agenda: what will happen to America itself given the looming presidential-election re-match next year between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Will America stay on its internationalist course, or deviate into a more [vengeful and organised](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/13/the-meticulous-ruthless-preparations-for-a-second-trump-term) form of Trumpian populism?

## Colson Whitehead’s “Crook Manifesto”

Colson Whitehead is the only author to win Pulitzer prizes for successive novels: his magnificent quasi-fantasy “The Underground Railroad” in 2017 and the overpraised [“The Nickel Boys”](https://https://www.https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/07/11/colson-whiteheads-searing-new-novel) three years later. “Crook Manifesto,” published on Tuesday, probably won’t get him a third, but it is still a hugely enjoyable work. It is his second to feature Ray Carney, a furniture-store owner and sometime fence, in Harlem, New York City, and it follows the same structure as the first, “Harlem Shuffle”, written in 2021. 

In three linked crime stories set over the course of the 1970s—(“Harlem Shuffle” took place in the 60s)—Carney straddles Harlem’s workaday and criminal worlds. To his credit Mr Whitehead, unlike many writers, takes plot seriously; the stories are sinuous and lithe. The best of them is the second, about the ramshackle making of a film called “Nefertiti TNT.” But Mr Whitehead’s real subject is Harlem: its customs and mores, transients and anchors, and its meaning to those who call it home.
