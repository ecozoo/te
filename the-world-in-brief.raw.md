The G7, a club of rich democracies, announced “enduring” new security guarantees for <strong>Ukraine</strong> at a meeting of <strong>NATO</strong> leaders in Vilnius, Lithuania. G7 countries will provide weapons and training to [Ukraine’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/12/natos-promises-to-ukraine-mark-real-progress) armed forces and share intelligence. On Wednesday Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, softened his criticism of NATO for not issuing a timetable to membership, claiming to have received “unambiguous clarity” that Ukraine is on a path to joining the alliance.

## Europe’s two-track economy

Services and manufacturing do not always grow hand-in-hand. But the current divergence in the euro zone—with services growing robustly, despite inflation and rising interest rates, while industry struggles—stands out. The weakness of industrial production worries economists especially, as it seems to be getting worse. Figures due on Thursday will offer a fresh look. 

The [energy shock](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/05/europes-economy-grapples-with-an-acute-energy-shock) in 2022, weaker than expected growth in China and higher interest rates worldwide were all bound to hurt Europe’s industry. A backlog of work from the post-pandemic boom helped compensate for lower current demand for a while, but not any more. In June, manufacturing recorded the steepest fall in outstanding orders in three years. To defeat inflation, a slackening of economic activity is essential, but crushing industry because services are too robust was never part of the [ECB’s plan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/23/how-fighting-inflation-could-imperil-the-euro-zone). The hoped-for soft landing may not happen everywhere: lots of cushioning for services, more of a crash for industry. 

## Prime ministerial problems in Thailand

Thailand’s parliament meets on Thursday to appoint a new prime minister. The country is ready for a young, [liberal leader](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/18/the-humiliation-of-thailands-regime-is-a-boost-for-asian-democracy)—but it probably won’t get one. In an election in May, the two main pro-democracy parties together—led by the 42-year-old Pita Limjaroenrat—won an outright majority of the popular vote. Mr Pita’s party, “Move Forward”, campaigned on a promise to reform the powerful [monarchy](https://www.economist.com/1843/2020/11/24/the-crown-and-the-crop-top-the-king-of-thailand-in-six-objects) and armed forces, two institutions that have long dominated the country.

Unsurprisingly, both have fought back, chiefly by accusing Mr Pita of failing to adequately declare his ownership of shares in a media firm. However specious the allegations, that prompted the election commission to recommend on Wednesday that Mr Pita be barred from public office; his case now moves to the constitutional court. Both the electoral commission and constitutional court are controlled by the military establishment. Even if he isn’t disqualified from the premiership, Mr Pita may struggle to win enough votes in parliament where senators, all of whom are appointed by the army, have an outsize role in picking the prime minister. Thailand’s political uncertainty continues to swirl.

## Slim hopes for peace in Sudan

Sudan’s neighbours meet on Thursday in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, to discuss ways to end the [12-week conflict](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/sudan-is-sliding-towards-civil-war) raging on their borders. They have their work cut out. What began as a narrow fight between Sudan’s regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces for control of [Khartoum](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/27/the-battle-for-khartoum-is-just-the-beginning-of-sudans-nightmare), the capital, is spreading menacingly to the country’s fringes. The UN recently warned that Sudan was on the brink of a “full-scale civil war”. 

Most worrying is the escalating conflict in Darfur, a western region the size of Spain. More than 190,000 refugees have already fled over the border to Chad. They are escaping [violence](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/11/28/sudans-revolution-could-end-the-conflict-in-darfur) by the RSF and allied Arab militias which the UN’s special envoy calls “ethnic cleansing, grand scale”. Many fear a repeat of the genocide in the 2000s that killed an estimated 300,000 people before a large force of UN and African Union peacekeepers arrived in 2007. With the UN committed elsewhere, at present the region’s non-Arabs cannot expect an international response along those lines. But the carnage may already be similar. 

## English doctors go on strike (again)

On Thursday junior doctors across England will walk out for five consecutive days. It will be the longest strike in the 75-year history of Britain’s beleaguered National Health Service, and the fourth in the current conflict between doctors and the government. The medics say their pay has fallen by 26% in real terms since 2008 and are demanding an inflation-busting increase to restore it. A week after the latest strike starts senior doctors, who are on a separate contract, will also down stethoscopes for two days.

Studies of previous medical strikes suggest that [patients are unlikely to die](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9643090/) as a direct result of industrial action—at least immediately. But the disruptions will still cause immense harm, because hundreds of thousands of procedures will be cancelled. The dispute looks unlikely to be resolved soon. In Scotland strikes were suspended after the government offered doctors a 17.5% pay rise over two years. South of the border, though, each side has accused the other of [walking away](https://news.sky.com/story/health-secretary-steve-barclay-criticises-junior-doctors-for-walking-away-from-talks-ahead-of-strike-12913284) from talks.

## American cricket makes a comeback

Cricket has a surprisingly long and rich history in America. The sport’s first ever international match was between America and Canada in New York in 1844. (Canada won.) Cricket was more popular than baseball before the civil war, and in recent years it has been gaining fans once again. On Thursday America’s first professional cricket league, [Major League Cricket](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/06/can-baseball-fans-be-won-over-by-the-worlds-second-biggest-sport), begins, when the Texas Super Kings face the LA Knight Riders in Grand Prairie, Texas. 

Given the increasing number of immigrants from cricket-playing countries in America, MLC could be a lasting success. Owners of teams in the wildly successful, highly lucrative Indian Premier League [have bought four](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/31/the-indian-premier-league-is-taking-over-global-cricket) of the MLC’s six sides. Their pulling power means that MLC teams are packed with some of the IPL’s top talent. America is also co-hosting the T20 World Cup—the shorter form of the game—with the West Indies in 2024. Time for the locals to brush up on the laws of the game.
