Emmanuel Macron, <strong>France’s </strong>president, postponed a three-day state visit to Germany that had been due to begin on Sunday, amid [widespread riots](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/01/rioting-in-france-presents-a-fresh-political-test-for-emmanuel-macron). The violence was sparked by the killing by police of Nahel M, a teenager, during a traffic stop in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris on June 27th. More than 1,300 people were arrested on Friday.

## Macron postpones state visit to Germany

Emmanuel Macron was due to begin a state visit to Germany on Sunday, the first for a French president in more than two decades. But on Saturday he postponed the trip due to “the domestic situation” in France. Nights of rioting in Paris and other cities, provoked by the fatal shooting of a teenager by a policeman on June 27th, have [shaken the country](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/01/rioting-in-france-presents-a-fresh-political-test-for-emmanuel-macron).

The rioting and looting present a particularly difficult challenge for Mr Macron. On the far left, the opposition has blamed government neglect and poverty for the unrest. On the hard right, Marine Le Pen has accused the government of a “lax” approach to law and order. The country remains tense, and the violence shows no sign of subsiding. In 2005 rioting after the deaths of two teenagers fleeing the police continued for three weeks, and required a state of emergency to end it.

## Saudi Arabia and Iran crawl towards co-operation

It was rumoured that [Saudi Arabia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/06/22/what-to-read-and-watch-to-understand-saudi-arabia) would reopen its embassy in Iran after the Eid al-Adha holiday, which ends this weekend. In March the two longtime foes agreed to restore diplomatic ties and reopen their missions within two months. Iran did so on June 6th. The Saudis seem less concerned by the deadline. “We’re working on it,” says their ambassador in Washington.

Both countries hope that tensions in the region will be lowered by the agreement—as does China, which [helped broker it](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/10/china-brokers-an-iran-saudi-rapprochement). Last month the Saudi foreign minister made a rare visit to Tehran, Iran’s capital. Hostile rhetoric has given way to talk of co-operation.

But tangible progress has been scant. The Saudis are yet to reach a permanent truce ending their [war in Yemen](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/a-prisoner-swap-is-a-symbolic-step-towards-ending-the-saudi-led-war-in-yemen), where they have fought an Iranian-backed militia for eight years. Talk of big Saudi investments in Iran remains just that. Even if they are no longer foes, the two countries are far from friends.

## India’s chess mastery

The inaugural Global Chess League will conclude in Dubai on Sunday. The tournament—a joint venture between Tech Mahindra, an Indian IT giant, and the International Chess Federation, features six teams of six. After facing off for more than ten days in a round-robin format, Triveni Continental Kings and UpGrad Mumba Masters have made it to the finals. Alpine Warriors (led by Magnus Carlsen, the world’s top player) and Ganges Grandmasters (headed by Viswanathan Anand, a former world champion) suffered shock upsets.

Tech Mahindra’s backing of the GCL reflects a surge in the popularity of chess in India. The country now boasts 82 grandmasters, up from just six in 2000. In February 2022 [Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa](http://espresso.economist.com/c09461ce85141b05d3ee6f2aea257935), a then 16-year-old Indian player, became the [youngest](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/11/13/the-queens-gambit-is-right-young-chess-stars-always-usurp-the-old) person ever to beat Mr Carlsen. Later that year Chennai hosted the Chess Olympiad, another international tournament. Mr Carlsen, a five-time world champion, has said he thinks India is on the brink of a “chess revolution”.

## Culture for kids

This weekend the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum will open “Young V&amp;A” in east London—an [updated incarnation](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/after-the-pandemic-a-feast-of-great-art-shows-is-coming) of its Museum of Childhood, following a three-year revamp. Children, teachers and local residents were involved in the design process, which the curator described as an attempt to create “the most joyful museum in the world”. The result centres around three galleries with the themes of “play”, “design” and “imagine”, including interactive spaces such as a storytelling stage and a den-building area.

Young V&amp;A is meant for children up to 14 years old: a group which, in 2021, made up nearly 18% of Britain’s population. Far fewer of them are now exposed to creative subjects in schools than was once the case. Between 2010 and 2022 the number of students studying “[arts](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/12/12/what-businesses-can-learn-from-the-arts)” subjects—such as design, drama and music—for their GCSEs (exams normally taken at age 16) in England fell by 40%. Institutions like Young V&amp;A are hoping to help fill that gap. 

## Weekend profile: Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first black president

“My parents believed that education opens every door,” said Claudine Gay, a political scientist, in a speech in December after she was appointed the 30th president of Harvard University. A spot in Harvard’s freshman class can indeed unlock doors. But Ms Gay—who starts her job on Saturday—will have to [rethink how the keys are allocated](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/29/how-american-universities-will-react-as-race-based-admissions-end) following the Supreme Court’s ruling that [ends race-based admissions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/29/why-americas-supreme-court-has-ended-affirmative-action). 

Ms Gay has said that her parents, Haitian immigrants who met while studying in New York, worked hard to put themselves through college. She was born in the Bronx in 1970, and grew up between Saudi Arabia, where her father worked for the US Army Corps of Engineers, and America, where she attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a selective boarding school. Her cousin, the author [Roxane Gay](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/the-economics-of-thinness), told the <em>Crimson</em>, Harvard’s student newspaper, that growing up abroad made Claudine “very resolute and badass and confident of her place in the world”. 

Her place seemed to be the upper echelon of American academia: she studied economics at Stanford University and political science at Harvard, where she began teaching in 2006. She has served as dean of two of its biggest schools. Ms Gay is the second woman to run Harvard in its nearly 400-year history, and the first non-white president.

In 2014 a group of [Asian Americans](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2015/10/03/the-model-minority-is-losing-patience), represented by a conservative lawyer-activist, sued Harvard, arguing that its consideration of race in admissions was discriminatory. (The policy, known as affirmative action, gave a leg-up to black, Hispanic and Native American applicants.) That lawsuit—and another against the University of North Carolina—worked its way up to the Supreme Court. On Thursday the conservative majority ruled for the plaintiffs. 

Ms Gay has credited campus diversity with improving students’ educational experiences by ensuring a “special alchemy” of backgrounds. Universities will now need a new approach, and many will no doubt be watching Harvard’s next steps<em>.</em> Hours after the decision, she responded in a video. The ruling, she said, only “strengthened our resolve to continue opening doors”.
