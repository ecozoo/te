<strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials said eight people were killed in the east and north of their country in <strong>Russian</strong> attacks on Friday night. Meanwhile the Russian governor of Crimea said that a drone attack on an ammunition depot had caused a brief closure of a bridge connecting the annexed peninsula to Russia, which was damaged by explosions this week. The governor of Belgorod province claimed Ukrainian forces had fired [cluster munitions](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/07/why-are-cluster-munitions-so-dangerous) at a village. America has recently agreed to supply such weapons, which many countries have banned, to Ukraine.

## Australians and Americans bond at sea

Talisman Sabre— a biennial military exercise between America, Australia and other countries—begins in earnest on Saturday as the <em>USS</em> <em>Canberra</em> is brought into active service. It will be the first time that an American warship is commissioned abroad. Named after an Australian heavy cruiser sunk in 1942 (pictured), the American littoral combat ship, an unusual trimaran designed to fight in coastal waters, entered Sydney harbour alongside its modern Australian namesake.

The festivities honour the tight bond between America and Australia, the strongest fibre in America’s growing [lattice](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/06/15/how-the-pentagon-thinks-about-americas-strategy-in-the-pacific) of alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to counterbalance China. With more than 30,000 troops from 16 countries, this year’s Talisman Sabre will be the largest yet. It will simulate amphibious landings, air assaults, air combat and more. Beyond showing that different military branches and countries can operate together, the exercise also signals that in any future war with China, say over Taiwan, America is unlikely to fight alone. 

## What is the future of the Latino vote?

This weekend over 1,500 delegates from all over America are gathering at McCormick Place, Chicago’s biggest convention centre, for the annual conference of UnidosUS. The organisation advocates progressive policies intended to help people of Latin American origin in the United States—in particular around immigration rights. The keynote speaker this year is Kamala Harris, America’s vice-president, who will champion “the economic power of the Hispanic community”. 

Among Democrats, [worries about the Latino vote](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/07/democrats-have-a-hispanic-problem) have grown. Though Latino voters largely remain more Democrat than Republican, a swing of some—particularly men—to the Republican cause over the past decade has helped the Grand Old Party become dominant in Florida, and slow the drift of places like Texas towards the Democrats. In last year’s midterm elections, 60% of Hispanics voted Democratic, down from 72% in 2018. Who knows about 2024? 

## A South Asian rave in London

The South-Asian Underground party scene has come a long way from its roots in the late 1980s. Young adults, keen to escape strict parents and a predominantly white club circuit, would once dance to <em>bhangra</em> (traditional [Punjabi dance music](https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/12/05/kuljit-bhamra)) and British garage electronic mashups at sweaty daytime raves. Now a new generation of British South Asian artists want their music to go global. 

This weekend the Dialled In festival returns to north-east London for a third year running. The line-up spans <em>dhol </em>drum classics to [drill-music](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/07/the-british-police-unit-helping-remove-drill-music-videos-from-the-web)—a genre of rap. Organised in collaboration with Daytimers, No ID, and Chalo, all UK-based collectives, the festival aims to highlight hybrid identities on the dance-music scene. So far it has been a raving success. Dialled In’s trademark mix of sounds could be heard at Glastonbury this summer. It has travelled farther afield, including at the first event held by Boiler Room, a London-based online broadcaster, in Pakistan last year.

## How to become more creative

Artists, kindergarten teachers, CEOs and techy types agree that creativity is a good thing. The World Economic Forum called it “the one skill that will future-proof you for the jobs market”. But few are sure what it is—or where to find it. Luckily, <em>The Economist </em>has recommended [the best books](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/07/12/what-to-read-to-become-more-creative) on the topic. 

Interested in the creative mind? “Wired to Create”, by Scott Barry Kaufman and Carolyn Gregoire, charts recent developments in neuroscience and psychology, focusing on ten things creative people do differently. “The Artist’s Way”, by Julia Cameron, is a more practical manual. Creative types such as Alicia Keys and Patricia Cornwall credit it as the source of their success. “The Cult of Creativity”, by Samuel Franklin, asks where the concept originated. His conclusion? That its rise dovetailed with post-war capitalism, when a new service economy rewarded different skills than Fordian manufacturing—an antidote for anyone who has sat, pen in hand, struggling to locate their “divine muse”.

## Weekend profile: Qin Gang, China’s missing foreign minister

At some point the ill-explained, [weeks-long disappearance](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/07/20/chinas-foreign-minister-goes-missing) of China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, will come to an end. Quite possibly Mr Qin will quietly resume his duties, just as suddenly as he stopped work after a day of meetings on June 25th. Perhaps he will explain the undefined health issues that remain the only official reason for his absence. Still, Mr Qin’s career path might be about to take a grimmer turn: grandees sometimes vanish, before reappearing to face charges of corruption, immorality or dissent.

Mr Qin’s absence is a big deal because he is seen as Xi Jinping’s protégé. From 2014 to 2017 he served as head of diplomatic protocol, which involved lots of contact with Mr Xi. Provoking some envy as he rose, Mr Qin was fast-tracked to ministerial rank and into the party’s central committee in 2022, not long after being made a deputy foreign minister and ambassador to Washington. 

Born in 1966 in Tianjin, a port city in the north-east, Mr Qin held a variety of roles in the foreign ministry, including two stints at the Chinese embassy in London. His familiarity with the West appears to co-exist with disdain. Indeed, some claim that Mr Qin reserves a special scorn for Western reporters, dating back to his first job after university, as a government-supplied researcher for an American news agency in Beijing. 

The foreign minister is sometimes called a “wolf warrior”, but truly wolfish envoys are often crudely anti-Western. Mr Qin is more sophisticated, capable of charm and pragmatism. As the protocol chief charged with delivering a successful state visit by Donald Trump to Beijing in November 2017, Mr Qin cleared red tape and de-escalated crises, including, allegedly, a brief physical altercation between the White House’s then chief of staff, John Kelly, and a Chinese security official. 

Yet Mr Qin has a talent for menace, too. He showed it in March 2021, when the European Union’s ambassador was summoned for a midnight dressing-down by Mr Qin, over EU sanctions relating to repression in Xinjiang. When the EU envoy resisted, he was warned to think of the consequences for his delegation, and by implication for the safety of his Chinese staff, diplomats relate. 

Still, Mr Qin’s absence is a source of regret on the capital’s diplomatic circuit. In Mr Xi’s China, the black box of elite politics is only getting more opaque. China’s ruling classes continue to heed codes of silence reminiscent of 1950s Beijing. When clever, candid officials vanish, they are missed.
