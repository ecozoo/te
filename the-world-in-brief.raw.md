A senior American official held “extremely frank” and “difficult” talks with <strong>Niger’s</strong> junta, with the aim of reinstating the ousted president, Mohamed Bazoum. Victoria Nuland, America’s acting deputy secretary of state, met the [coup leaders](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/08/01/why-the-nightmare-in-niger-is-the-worlds-problem) in Niamey, the capital. She encouraged the military government to restore democratic order but said she made little progress. The junta refused to let Ms Nuland meet Mr Bazoum, who is under house arrest. The Economic Community of West African States, a regional bloc, will hold a summit in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on Thursday, to discuss the coup.

## Pakistan’s political uncertainty continues

This week Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan’s prime minister, is expected to dissolve parliament and appoint a caretaker government ahead of a general election later this year. The election will probably be delayed, after the government said on Saturday that the electorate would reflect a new census. The authorities expect to take up to four months to redraw constituencies. So parliament granted additional powers to the future caretaker government, allowing it to implement the conditions of a loan agreement with the IMF. 

Elections—whenever held—will likely be conducted without Imran Khan, a previous prime minister. His conviction at the weekend for “corrupt practices” disqualifies him from parliament for five years. Mr Khan’s lawyers said they will appeal. But he faces [dozens of other charges](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/01/imran-khan-loses-his-battle-with-pakistans-army) including blasphemy and terrorism. With his status having sunk in one parliamentary term from prime minister to that of a convict banned from politics, Mr Khan is the latest to learn the unforgiving nature of Pakistani politics.

## SoftBank avoids another hard landing

SoftBank, a Japanese investment giant, reports its quarterly results on Tuesday. The company has had a [tough time](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/16/after-a-bruising-year-softbank-braces-for-more-pain) of late. The collapse of the tech industry shrank the value of many of its big bets. The Vision Fund, its venture-capital unit, has lost ¥6.9trn ($48bn) over the past two years.

But analysts expect the fund to have made a profit in the latest quarter, largely because excitement around [artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/17/how-to-invest-in-artificial-intelligence) may have lifted the value of its investments in tech startups. AI has helped raise the Nasdaq composite, a tech-heavy index, by 33% this year. Another boost for SoftBank will come from the initial public offering of Arm, a British firm that produces the blueprints for many semiconductors. SoftBank bought Arm in 2016 for $32bn. Its valuation target is predicted to be $60bn-$70bn, with a listing possibly as soon as September. Tuesday’s earnings may reveal more clues about what could be a blockbuster IPO.

## The European housing market

Is it time to invest in European housing again? House prices have probably bottomed out. Figures for the first three months of 2023 showed a quarterly decline in many European countries. But prices in Germany increased in the second quarter, and other countries may follow. With inflation [mostly coming down](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/05/economists-draw-swords-over-how-to-fix-inflation), interest rates and hence mortgage rates could drop, too. That might tempt buyers. On Tuesday, the European Central Bank releases its latest survey on what consumers think of house prices, and their predictions for the wider economy. 

In the surveys in April and May, the median consumer had expected stagnating house prices and household incomes for the next 12 months, anticipating that mortgage rates would remain at 4.5% over the same period. Inflation has slowed further since, which would usually bring down interest rates. But markets are unconvinced: rates went up a notch for both short and longer term debt. For homebuyers deciding when to move, getting the timing right will not be easy. 

## Ohio decides how to decide

On Tuesday Ohioans vote on whether to make their constitution harder to change. The Republican state legislature put an amendment on the ballot in May. It would require future citizen-led campaigns to collect signatures from every county in the state, rather than just half, to secure a ballot. It would also raise the threshold to pass an amendment from a simple majority to 60%.

  
 Some state Republicans have been open about their motives for the timing of the proposal. Ohioans vote in November on whether to introduce a right to an abortion into their constitution. Since the overturning of <em>Roe v Wade</em> last year, six states have voted on abortion. In each, voters have [protected access to it](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/11/where-abortion-was-on-the-ballot-americans-voted-to-protect-it), but in Michigan, Kansas and Kentucky the abortion-rights campaign won with less than 60% of the vote. Activists in Ohio are litigating against a six-week abortion ban, passed in 2019. In Ohio the battle over abortion access is being fought in the courts and on the ballots, too.

## Jamie Lee Curtis’s environmental horror story

On Tuesday Jamie Lee Curtis, an Oscar-winning actress, publishes a graphic novel, “Mother Nature”, co-written with Russell Goldman and illustrated in photo-realistic watercolour by Karl Stevens. Ms Curtis rose to fame at 19 in a slasher film, “Halloween”. At that age—recognising what she calls the “unbalanced relationship between humans and nature”—she began conjuring up a dark plot in which [nature retaliates](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/04/film-makers-are-finding-horror-not-comfort-in-the-natural-world). Now she has brought it to life with gory graphics, featuring skull-shattering hailstorms, a man impaled by a pumpjack and deadly tornadoes. 

Through a plot that involves environmental cover-ups and supernatural vengeance, the fossil-fuel industry (in the shape of the fictitious Cobalt Corporation) is turned into a comic-book villain. “Mother Nature” is being released during a summer of extreme, and deadly, weather conditions. The story uses bloody violence typical of the horror genre to engage readers who might otherwise be apathetic about the environment. Curtis has teased she might play the dastardly boss of Cobalt in a film adaptation.
