<strong>Colorado’s </strong>supreme court ruled that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is ineligible to run for president again and cannot appear on the state’s primary ballot. The extraordinary decision, against which Mr Trump is sure to appeal to America’s Supreme Court, is the first to disqualify the former president based on a provision in the [14th Amendment barring insurrectionists](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/21/does-a-civil-war-era-ban-on-insurrectionists-apply-to-donald-trump) from holding office. Similar lawsuits have been filed in nearly 30 states. The Colorado court’s decision will not take effect until January 4th, to accommodate appeals.

## 2023 in review: the rise of the hermit consumer

<em>This week we are looking back on 2023. Today, business</em>

In some ways [covid-19 was a blip](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/22/welcome-to-the-age-of-the-hermit-consumer). Most countries re-attained their pre-covid GDP in short order. But more than two years after lockdowns were lifted, consumer habits across the rich world have shifted decisively.

Before covid the share of spending devoted to services, from hotel stays to haircuts, was rising steadily. In 2023 it remained stubbornly at pre-covid level. People are still less interested in leisure activities that take place outside the home. In countries that spent more time in lockdown, hermit habits have become ingrained. Japan has witnessed a 50% decline in restaurant bookings for business purposes.

One possible reason is that some people remain afraid of infections. Another is work patterns: across the rich world people now regularly work from home. And covid may have made people genuinely more hermit-like: people are spending less on social activities and more on solitary pursuits. Covid’s biggest legacy, it seems, has been to pull people apart.

## 2023 in review: AI’s big year

This year artificial intelligence left the lab and entered the mainstream. Within two months of its launch in November 2022 ChatGPT, a chatbot created by [OpenAI](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/23/sam-altmans-return-marks-a-new-phase-for-openai), a company backed by Microsoft, had racked up 100m users. Internet searches for “artificial intelligence” surged; more than $40bn in venture capital flowed into AI in the first half of 2023 alone. 

The craze for consumer experimentation has since cooled. But an entirely [new industry](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up) centred on supercharged AI models started taking shape this year. The emerging order still sees OpenAI ahead technologically, but deep-pocketed rivals such as Google may yet catch up.

Along with the AI hype, there has been a rise in “doomer” discourse. Some believe that, left unchecked, AI poses an existential risk to humanity. Britain and America have asked model-makers, like OpenAI and Microsoft, to make non-binding commitments to allow external experts to test AI products before they release them to the public. As the industry continues to grow, the experts will have their hands full.

## 2023 in review: The Sino-American tech war

In 2023 the simmering tech battle between America and China got hotter. It began in earnest in 2019, when Donald Trump’s administration banned the sale of high-end chips to Huawei, a Chinese telecoms-equipment maker. In 2022, when Joe Biden introduced a blanket ban on the sales of advanced semiconductors to all companies in China, leaders in Beijing took months to formulate [a response](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/04/in-its-tech-war-with-america-china-brings-out-the-big-guns). But over the past year China has appeared far more prepared to fight.

In July, for example, China announced export controls on gallium and germanium, two rare metals needed to make state-of-the-art chips. And in October, when America said it would strengthen its chip controls, China retaliated just three days later, saying it would impose new export controls on graphite.

America has already dragged allies such as Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea into the fight. It will probably try to recruit more. Chinese companies, for their part, have found clever workarounds to get their hands on chips via less scrutinised markets.

## 2023 in review: Worker v machine

The story of unions in America, until now largely one of [declining power](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/14/americas-unions-are-gentrifying), changed in 2023. Labour strikes in two industries grappling with technological upheaval yielded high-profile victories for workers. The gains, however, may be short-lived.

Hollywood’s writers took to the picket lines in May; actors joined them in July. Both groups fret about the effects of streaming platforms and artificial intelligence on their pay cheques and intellectual property. They each won meaningful concessions, including loose terms governing AI use and bonuses for shows that do well on streaming. But new terms can hardly contain AI, which has already begun to[ transform fame](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/09/now-ai-can-write-sing-and-act-is-it-still-possible-to-be-a-star).

Farther east, the car industry faced its own upset. In September members of the United Auto Workers, frustrated by shrinking benefits since the financial crisis, [began simultaneous strikes](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes) affecting all of Detroit’s “big three” carmakers. The UAW members won pay rises, but, as with Hollywood’s workers, new technology may soon threaten their jobs. Electric vehicles are mechanically simpler than conventional ones—and less labour-intensive to build.
