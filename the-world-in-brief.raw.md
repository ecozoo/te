The Biden administration confirmed that it would send <strong>cluster munitions</strong> to <strong>Ukraine</strong>. Jake Sullivan, America’s top national-security official, said the decision was “difficult”. Because unexploded bomblets from [cluster munitions](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/04/ukraine-wants-american-cluster-bombs-quickly)—which release a large amount of smaller bombs—pose long-term risks to civilians, a law bans their export, though the president can override it. America will provide munitions with a low “dud rate”, below 2.35%.

## Russia wields its social conservatism

In Russia Saturday is Peter and Fevronia Day, or “Day of Family, Love and Fidelity”—a holiday trumpeting traditional family values. The symbolism chimes with President Vladimir Putin’s fierce social conservatism. In December Russia expanded its “homosexual propaganda” law to ban the promotion of “non-traditional sexual relationships” not only to children, but adults too. In June the lower house of Russia’s parliament passed a bill banning gender-reassignment surgery and the changing of a person’s gender on official documents. 

Mr Putin uses what he sees as a clash of [values](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/07/28/vladimir-putin-is-in-thrall-to-a-distinctive-brand-of-russian-fascism) to justify his invasion of Ukraine. He paints Western societies as hotbeds of debauchery; for example he has said that teaching children about gender fluidity is “on the verge of a crime against humanity”. The Kremlin, he avers, will protect its people from these sordid influences. In practice, that means embedding militaristic nationalism into [everyday life](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/04/vladimir-putin-wants-to-militarise-russian-schools), such as by introducing lessons on “Russian values” at schools. But as Mr Putin’s bloody war drags on, many Russians may realise that they don’t mind Western norms so much after all.

## Latvia’s intrepid new president

Diplomats are supposed to be conciliatory, but [Baltic ones](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/06/the-baltic-states-fear-that-nato-is-being-complacent) do not mince words when it comes to their neighbour, Russia. One of the sharpest-tongued is Edgars Rinkevics, Latvia’s foreign minister since 2011. He calls Russia an “evil empire” and accuses it of committing genocide in Ukraine. On Saturday Mr Rinkevics will become Latvia’s president, having been elected by the country’s parliament in May. As the country’s first openly gay head of state, he will stand as a rebuke to Vladimir Putin’s oppressive cultural ideology.

The war in Ukraine has been tough on Latvia, which depended on Russia for gas. In the war’s first year inflation passed 20%. Domestic politics is somewhat paralysed: the prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, who wields more real power than the largely ceremonial president, may reshuffle his cabinet to push through reforms. But Latvians’ geopolitical prestige has grown: they can tell the West they were right about Russia all along.

## Improving bone transplants

After [blood](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/11/09/blood-cells-made-in-a-lab-have-been-infused-into-people), bone is the most commonly transplanted tissue. But bone grafts are painful, costly and can compensate only for small defects. For larger defects, you need a scaffold—a 3D implant that gives structure to growing bone. But that is tricky: soft scaffolds cannot hold much weight, and in harder ones cells struggle to divide. Now, researchers at the Technical University of Denmark have built a scaffold that balances structure and flexibility.

Like native bone, their scaffold marries a hard framework with a soft matrix where transplanted cells can proliferate. The engineers implanted it, loaded with bone-marrow stem cells, into rats with defects in their skulls. It enhanced bone growth by 84% after eight weeks of healing, far outperforming previous scaffolds. The researchers claim that they can halve the healing time and revolutionise orthopaedics. Helpfully, the scaffold is built from materials already approved by America’s Food and Drug Administration.

## A Rugby World Cup preview in Pretoria

The Rugby Championship, a four-team tournament between southern-hemisphere sides, starts on Saturday in Pretoria, [South Africa](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/rugby-brings-south-africa-together-if-only-for-80-minutes). The championship features three leading contenders to win the Rugby World Cup in France, which begins in two months. 

Australia’s head coach, Eddie Jones (pictured), is back after 17 seasons away, having led teams such as England and Japan. He has just five matches to imprint his methods on Australia’s players before the real business—the World Cup. Expect some experimentation. New Zealand, meanwhile, had a woeful 2022 by their standards, losing a match to Argentina in the Rugby Championship and a home Test series to Ireland for the first time. Ian Foster clung on to his job as coach, but will need at least two wins to build confidence for France. Finally, South Africa have an experienced, settled squad and will aim to inflict a psychological blow on New Zealand, a team they might meet in the World Cup quarter-finals.

## Weekend profile: Barbie

Sporting a black-and-white striped swimsuit, red lips and a sideways gaze, Barbie first tottered off the production line in 1959. She was named after the daughter of the couple who developed her, but her figure was copied from an erotic doll sold to German men. American children were besotted; their mothers fretted that the 11.5-inch, anatomically impossible woman was a bad influence. So Barbie was given a job (as a model) and marketed as a way to teach girls to look neat and stylish. On Sunday, 64 years later—yet not one day older—she will grace the pink carpet for the Hollywood premiere of “Barbie”, her first live-action film.

Barbie’s inventor was [Ruth Handler](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2002/05/02/ruth-handler). With her husband she founded Mattel, the toymaker that still owns Barbie. Barbie prototypes were mistakenly given nipples. Deemed too outré, they were delicately filed off. In 1961 Barbie acquired a preppie boyfriend, Ken. 

Handler believed that “little girls want to pretend to be bigger girls” and that Barbie would free them from the infantilising world of baby dolls. Never presented as a wife or a mother, Barbie has had 250 careers including astronaut, surgeon and presidential candidate. Still, many feminists have long despaired at her unrealistic shape, materialism and conformity to gender stereotypes. Lamenting that “math class is tough” did a 1992-era talking Barbie few favours. The best-selling Barbie model, also sold in the 1990s, had floor-length hair, irresistible for brushing. Barbie’s biographer, M.G. Lord, calls this “a modern re-enactment of an ancient goddess-cult ritual”.

Baby-boomers who grew up with Barbie bought her for their children. Mattel needs those millennial children, now parents themselves, to do the same. But there is more competition these days: Barbie’s crown has been threatened by Elsa, the star of Disney’s “Frozen”; Lego is [ascendant](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/07/27/why-chinese-parents-prefer-lego-to-barbie). So Mattel has given Barbie a makeover. In 2016 she was relaunched with seven skin tones and four new body shapes. 

But what better marketing ploy than a feature-length advert? The doll’s on-screen universe is a kitschy, girlie utopia until one Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, starts asking existential questions. Trailers have lit up social media in advance of the film’s opening in cinemas on July 21st. It will take a truly determined parent to avoid Barbiemania this summer.
