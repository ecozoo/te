<strong>Niger’s</strong> military government vowed to prosecute <strong>Mohamed Bazoum</strong>, the deposed president, for “high treason”. The junta, which [seized power last month](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/08/01/fanatics-and-putschists-are-creating-failed-states-in-west-africa), accused Mr Bazoum of “undermining the internal and external security of Niger”. Earlier a group of Islamic scholars met the coup leaders in Niamey, the capital, to hold mediation talks. They reported that Niger’s generals are open to diplomacy and talks with West African leaders. Previous attempts by ECOWAS, a regional bloc, to peacefully restore the civilian government have been rebuffed. 

## India battles rising food prices

To taste the effects of inflation in India, visit a fast-food restaurant. Last week the American chain Subway announced that it would no longer add a free cheese slice to its sandwiches because of rising costs. Similarly, many McDonald’s outlets have done away with tomatoes in their burgers. Food prices have risen because of erratic monsoons, which have submerged crops in parts of the country. 

As a result, inflation has surged. Data released on Monday will probably reveal that the annual inflation rate accelerated to 6.4% in July, from 4.8% in June. That would exceed the central bank’s upper threshold of 6%. Last week the bank left interest rates unchanged for a third consecutive meeting since April, but sustained food inflation may force it back into action. The [government ](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/13/america-is-courting-india-in-part-for-its-growing-econom)has already acted, restricting exports of rice to slow rising domestic prices. With a general election scheduled next year, the government knows Indian voters won’t stomach rising costs. 

## The Muslim Brotherhood’s identity crisis

When Muhammad Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was ousted in a coup, his followers protested in Rabaa Square, in Cairo. On August 14th 2013, Egyptian security forces killed at least 900 members of the Brotherhood gathered there. Ten years later the group has barely [recovered](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/12/09/the-muslim-brotherhood-is-tearing-itself-apart).

Many of those who survived the massacre were thrown into prison; others fled into exile. In 2020 Mahmoud Ezzat, the Brotherhood’s then leader, was arrested. The succession dispute that followed was unusually messy.

But the Brotherhood elected a new acting “general guide”, or leader, 78-year-old Salah Abudlhaq, in March of this year. Mr Abulhaq’s arrival could signal a new start. He has been far removed from the recent internal squabbles. Nonetheless, he will have his work cut out. The government has not yet loosened its hold on the Brotherhood. The anniversary on Monday will probably pass relatively quietly. Members fear that any protests would be aggressively dispersed—again. 

## Just for one day: Zimbabwe’s Heroes’ Day

Monday will be no ordinary Heroes’ Day in Zimbabwe. The day is supposed to commemorate the thousands of people who lost their lives in the “liberation war” of the 1960s and ’70s that led to the end of white-run Rhodesia and the establishment of Zimbabwe in 1980 under the rule of Robert Mugabe. But with a general election due on August 23rd Zanu-PF, the party that has misruled the country since independence, will use the moment for political rallies. 

It will argue, falsely, that it alone liberated the country and insist that only Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s successor, can keep the revolution [alive](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/15/china-is-helping-zimbabwe-to-build-a-surveillance-state). Many—almost certainly most—Zimbabweans are beyond tired of this hogwash. [Decades](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/03/28/zimbabwe-wants-to-come-in-from-the-col) of corruption, idiotic policies and thuggery mean that real GDP per capita is lower today than in 1980. But Zanu-PF has a history of rigging elections. There are ample reasons to believe it will try to do so again.

## Alabama’s political map goes back to court

In June the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to re-draw its electoral map. In 2021 the state’s legislature created one with just a single majority-black district out of seven, though black Alabamans comprise 27% of the voting-age population. The Supreme Court agreed with a lower court’s decision: the map violated the Voting Rights Act. 

On Monday the district court that rejected the first map will consider the legislature’s revised effort. The Supreme Court instructed lawmakers to create a second majority-black district “or something quite close”. Republicans, who have a super-majority in the legislature, are testing that formulation. Their proposed map preserves one majority-black district and increases the share of black voters in a second to just under 40%. It all but ensures that Alabama will continue to send six Republicans to the House of Representatives (black voters tend to prefer Democrats), where the GOP has a razor-thin majority. Republicans hail a “compromise”; the district court might see it differently.

## The way to rob a (central) bank

How can $101m disappear from a bank? It is a question investigators struggled to answer in 2016, when [hackers stole](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/03/23/the-investigation-into-the-bangladesh-bank-heist-continues) that sum from Bangladesh’s central bank. “Billion Dollar Heist”, a documentary which comes out on Monday, explains how scammers used SWIFT, a cross-border payments network, to wire funds from the bank’s deposit with America’s Federal Reserve to accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The show’s title seemingly refers to the fact that, if not for their sloppiness, the cybercriminals could have escaped with $1bn. 

The story is well suited to the screen. It features shadowy baddies, obscure online worlds and transnational criminal operations. Audiences were hooked by “[The Lazarus Heist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/03/23/the-investigation-into-the-bangladesh-bank-heist-continues)”, a podcast and subsequent book about state-sponsored hackers in North Korea (the same group was probably behind the Bangladesh scam). And our sister magazine,<em> 1843</em>, [recently reported on the theft](https://www.economist.com/interactive/1843/2023/07/27/the-baghdad-job-who-was-behind-historys-biggest-bank-heist) of $2.5bn from Iraq’s largest state bank. It seems no prize is too big for today’s bank robbers.
