## The world in brief 2023-05-24

Mikhail Mishustin, <strong>Russia’s </strong>prime minister, signed several agreements with <strong>China </strong>during a trip to Beijing. Mr Mishustin said [relations between the two countries](https://www.economist.com/russias-reliance-on-china-will-persist-even-after-vladimir-putin-is-gone-says-alexander-gabuev) are “at an unprecedented high level” amid “sensational pressure from the collective West”. He is the highest-ranking official to visit China since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The deals included commitments to strengthen trade in agriculture and services. 

Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s <strong>Belgorod</strong> region, claimed that several drones had been intercepted above his territory overnight. Russia earlier claimed to have repelled [pro-Ukrainian militias](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/05/23/who-are-the-pro-ukrainian-militias-raiding-russias-belgorod-region) raiding the region, which borders Ukraine, although this claim could not be verified. America insisted it did not “encourage or enable strikes inside of Russia”. Ukraine also denied any involvement. 

<strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, Florida’s governor, will reportedly announce his bid for America’s presidency in an audio discussion with Elon Musk on Twitter on Wednesday. Meanwhile, his rival for the Republican nomination got a court date: a judge in New York said that <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> [trial over hush-money payments](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/30/prosecuting-donald-trump-over-stormy-daniels-looks-like-a-mistake) to a porn star would begin in March 2024, coinciding with the busiest season for primaries.

<strong>Britain’s</strong> inflation rate dipped below 10% for the first time in eight months. <strong>Prices </strong>rose by 8.7% in the year to April, down from 10.1% in [March](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/04/19/britains-inflation-rate-is-not-falling-fast-enough). But food inflation was 19.1%, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, warned that the figures were still “worryingly high”. The Bank of England’s target is just 2%. 

<strong>Typhoon Mawar</strong>, a cyclone with the strength of a category-four hurricane, edged towards [Guam](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/02/guam-where-americas-next-war-may-begin). Should the storm make direct landfall on the island, it will be Guam’s worst in years. The <strong>American territory</strong> has already been left without power. Earlier, President Joe Biden declared an emergency and residents not living in concrete houses were advised to seek safety elsewhere. 

The world’s 1,200 biggest <strong>publicly listed companies </strong>collectively issued <strong>dividends</strong> worth a record $327bn in the first quarter of 2023, a year-on-year jump of 12%, according to a study released by Janus Henderson, a fund manager. The banking and oil sectors were among the biggest payers. One-off special dividends also boosted payouts.

<strong>Target</strong> said it was pulling some [<strong>LGBT</strong>](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/13/americas-far-right-is-increasingly-protesting-against-lgbt-people) merchandise from its stores to protect its employees. The unspecified items are part of the American retail chain’s<strong> Pride Collection</strong>, which it has run for more than a decade to mark Pride Month in June. But since introducing this year’s collection, Target has faced threats and “confrontational behaviour” in some of its stores.

## Ron DeSantis runs

On Wednesday Ron DeSantis will officially declare his bid for America’s presidency—during a discussion with Elon Musk on Twitter, according to news reports. Mr DeSantis is the most formidable Republican challenger to Donald Trump, but he has lost momentum since [cruising to re-election](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/09/the-rise-of-ron-desanctimonious) as Florida’s governor last year. A blunder over the Ukraine war (he called it a [“territorial dispute”](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/03/16/ron-desantis-emboldens-vladimir-putin)), his [feud with Disney](https://www.economist.com/united-states/what-ron-desantiss-spat-with-disney-says-about-american-politics/21808962) and his decision to enact a [ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/15/ron-desantiss-six-week-abortion-ban-brings-risks-to-women) have [raised doubts](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/04/30/ron-desantiss-lurch-in-florida-hurts-his-presidential-chances) about his political acumen.

An average of recent polls of Republican voters suggests that they prefer the former president to Mr DeSantis by 56% to 21%. The party’s convention in July 2024, where the nominee will be crowned, is still about 60 weeks from now. But even primary-race polls taken this early tend to predict later performance. Mr DeSantis’s chances of reaching the general election are not zero, but they are small.

## Lukashenko shakes off health rumours

President Vladimir Putin will host [Alexander Lukashenko](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/11/05/in-belarus-neither-dictator-nor-protesters-are-backing-down), his Belarusian counterpart, in Moscow on Wednesday. That is not unusual: the two leaders meet frequently. But onlookers might be paying extra attention to Mr Lukashanko’s demeanour amid rumours that his health has deteriorated. The dictator disappeared from public view for a week this month. Doctors suspected that the 68-year-old had viral heart inflammation, independent Belarusian media reported. That is treatable. Still, speculation is rife about what will happen if he dies soon.

Mr Lukashenko, who has governed Belarus since 1994, has named no successor. The country’s exiled opposition hopes his death will bring about a democratic opening. But many worry that Belarusians—thousands of whom were jailed and tortured for [protesting](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/11/05/in-belarus-neither-dictator-nor-protesters-are-backing-down) against the rigging of elections in 2020—will be too afraid to rise up again in defence of democracy should Mr Lukashenko die. In addition, Russian security forces might well intervene to ensure that the next president is not someone with Ukraine-like ideas about freeing Belarus from [the Kremlin’s influence](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/03/17/how-belaruss-role-in-the-invasion-of-ukraine-could-grow). 

## Nvidia capitalises on AI hype

Nvidia, the world’s sixth-most-valuable listed company, reports earnings on Wednesday. It is expected to be a celebratory affair. The chipmaker has been the top performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index of listed firms in 2023, doubling in value since the start of year. The success of ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, an American startup, has boosted bullish investor sentiment around artificial intelligence. That has caused demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units, the specialised chips used to train big AI models, to surge. 

Nvidia’s role as the [“infrastructure” provider](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/08/01/will-nvidias-huge-bet-on-artificial-intelligence-chips-pay-off) for AI makes it well positioned to turn a profit. It produces custom software to run on its chips that developers worldwide have grown accustomed to, helping to lock in customers. And the firm is continuing to innovate. In March it revealed software that will make lithography—the process of printing a chip’s design onto a chip wafer—far more efficient. That should give investors yet more reasons to be cheerful.

## Go First, a struggling Indian airline

Aviation in [India](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade) is flying high, but with some turbulence. On April 30th domestic airlines carried more than 450,000 people, a new daily record. Yet just a few days later Go First, a budget airline and India’s fourth-largest carrier, filed for bankruptcy. It blamed “defective and failing engines” made by Pratt &amp; Whitney, an American firm, for grounding half of its fleet and costing it 108bn rupees ($1.3bn). Pratt &amp; Whitney denies the allegations.

The insolvency application forced Go First to suspend its flights. The company was hoping to resume them on Wednesday, but that has since been pushed back. On Monday an appeals court helped Go First by preventing aircraft lessors from taking back planes leased to the airline. But pilots and cabin crew are getting restless as [Air India](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/12/a-humiliating-incident-on-an-air-india-flight-triggers-outrage) and IndiGo, the market leaders, look to recruit. In truth, Go First may struggle to take off again. 

## Spotting gravitational waves

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory—the world’s most sensitive device for spotting gravitational waves—starts up again on Wednesday after a three-year hiatus for upgrades.

LIGO is [designed](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/06/01/gravity-wave-detectors-offer-a-new-way-to-look-at-the-universe) to detect subtle ripples in space and time radiated out by cataclysmic cosmic events like colliding black holes and supernovae. The existence of these cosmic wiggles was predicted, over a century ago, by the mathematics of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But it was only confirmed when LIGO [observed](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/02/13/gravitational-waves-have-been-detected-for-the-first-time) the waves in 2015. The upgrades to LIGO’s instruments have resulted in more sensitive detectors, capable of observing far fainter gravitational-wave events than before.

LIGO consists of two American detectors in the states of Louisiana and Washington. It will be joined on this run by Virgo and KAGRA, LIGO’s European and Japanese equivalents. Astrophysicists hope that the joint sensitivity of these observatories will be enough to detect waves from the universe’s earliest origins.
