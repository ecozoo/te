Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, said the alliance was “monitoring closely” the whereabouts of <strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin</strong>, the mutinous head of the Wagner group of Russian mercenaries, and his troops. He confirmed Mr Prigozhin had been “moving around”. Earlier[ Alexander Lukashenko](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/29/how-much-power-does-alexander-lukashenko-have), <strong>Belarus’s</strong> president, said that Mr Prigozhin was in St Petersburg, not Belarus. Mr Prigozhin has not been seen in public since the[ rebellion](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/25/the-meaning-of-prigozhins-short-lived-mutiny) against Russia’s leaders on June 23rd. He had agreed to stop his march on Moscow in exchange for amnesty for his soldiers and exile to Belarus.

## Yellen’s olive branch to China

It has been more than four years since America’s top economic official last visited China. Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, is trying to make up for some of that lost time: she arrived in Beijing on Thursday and will depart on Sunday. A few days of high-level meetings cannot address, let alone solve, all of the problems [bedevilling the relationship](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/04/in-its-tech-war-with-america-china-brings-out-the-big-guns) between the world’s two biggest economies. Even so, more dialogue is a step in the right direction.

As the member of Joe Biden’s cabinet seen as most friendly towards China, Ms Yellen is a good emissary for [rebuilding diplomatic bridges](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/06/09/america-and-china-try-to-move-past-a-new-bump-in-relations). She is likely to tell her Chinese counterparts, including [He Lifeng](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/29/who-will-be-chinas-next-economic-tsar), the country’s economic tsar, that America still wants deep commercial ties. But Chinese officials are well aware that security hawks dominate [policy circles](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/16/the-fault-lines-in-americas-china-policy) in Washington these days, and that doves like Ms Yellen are an increasingly rare breed.

## America walks an economic tightrope

America’s job market is perhaps the most important variable in the global economy today. If hiring remains ultra-strong, the [Federal Reserve](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/15/sooner-or-later-americas-financial-system-could-seize-up) will probably press on with raising interest rates, even at the risk of causing financial turmoil. If, however, unemployment shoots up, the Fed would stop tightening, knowing that growth is stalling.

But for now, a more ambiguous scenario looks probable: the job market may remain robust enough to justify at least one more rate increase but with [enough cracks](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/05/05/americas-jobs-report-is-not-as-strong-as-it-seems) in it to provoke concern that the Fed is going too far. A raft of data out on Friday is expected to show that job creation in June was strong by historical standards but weaker than in previous months. At the same time, the unemployment rate probably ticked up. But rapid wage growth may still point to stubbornly high inflation. Getting the policy balance right is only getting harder.

## Taiwan eyes a tech rebound

Most of the world’s semiconductors, used in everything from smartphones to advanced American weaponry, are [made in Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/06/taiwans-dominance-of-the-chip-industry-makes-it-more-important). The island also makes gadgets, such as personal computers, and various components. A slowdown in global tech demand, largely caused by inflation, is thus squeezing its export-dependent economy. Exports have shrunk year-on-year for nine consecutive months, causing it to slip into recession. On Friday the ministry of finance will release the latest trade figures.

DBS, a Singaporean bank, estimates that exports fell by 13.1% year-on-year in June—a slight improvement on May’s 14.1%. And economists expect a further improvement for Taiwan’s economy. The AI hype could help boost export demand. And an end to the region’s brutal pandemic lockdowns has sparked new life into the island’s restaurants, shops and other services. Unemployment reached a 22-year low in April. Economic growth could be back in positive territory by the third quarter, according to DBS.

## The Church of England at loggerheads

On Friday the Church of England’s legislative body, the general synod, gathers in York for a five-day session. The mood is gloomy. Two weeks ago the church disbanded its independent safeguarding board, a panel of three experts who scrutinised the institution’s response to [abuse](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse) of all kinds, including sexual. Two members of the panel told the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, a newspaper, that the church had been obstructing their work.

That is not the synod’s only problem. At its previous meeting in February, it approved a controversial plan to bless—but not conduct—same-sex marriages. Liberals wanted to go further, and criticised church leaders for reaffirming a resolution from 1998 stating that gay sex was “incompatible with scripture”. Conservatives opposed the reforms. The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which claims to represent three-quarters of the world’s Anglicans, said earlier this year the Church of England had disqualified itself as its “mother church”. Expect a tense gathering.

## PJ Harvey’s new musical landscape

In the fourth decade of her career, [PJ Harvey](https://www.economist.com/1843/2015/10/20/pj-harvey-singer-turned-poet), an English songwriter, remains a unique figure in alternative rock. Abrasive early works, such as “50ft Queenie”, are still much imitated. But Ms Harvey has long since moved on, creating more textured music in ever-evolving forms. Her new album, “I Inside the Old Year Dying”, arrives seven years after her last. It is characteristically oblique, yet there is no mistaking that this complex, atmospheric record, played largely live in the studio, is an intimate portrait of the landscape, nature and seasons of her native Dorset.

The themes and mood on “I Inside” recall Kate Bush’s experimental song suite “The Ninth Wave”. Its depth, range and intensity mark it out as a rural counterpart to William Doyle’s “Your Wilderness Revisited”, an album celebrating the suburbs, released in 2019. Ms Harvey makes these songs feel as if they have grown directly out of the West Country’s ancient soil.
