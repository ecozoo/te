Israel agreed to allow two trucks of <strong>diesel </strong>a day into the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong>, after the UN suspended aid deliveries owing to a lack of fuel. The UN World Food Programme also warned that there was an “immediate possibility of starvation” in the enclave. Most of northern Gaza now appears to be [under Israel’s control](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/15/the-battle-of-northern-gaza-is-almost-over); this includes al-Shifa hospital, the enclave’s largest medical facility, where the Israel Defence Forces continued its operation. It said it had found a <strong>Hamas</strong> tunnel underneath the building, and recovered weapons. It also discovered the bodies of two hostages taken during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7th.

## America discusses Gaza’s future in Bahrain

Over the weekend officials from around the world will gather in Bahrain’s capital for the Manama Dialogue, an annual security powwow. It will be contentious. President Joe Biden’s senior Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk (pictured), is expected to participate, and will surely get an earful from his Arab counterparts. They want a ceasefire in Gaza, but Mr Biden refuses to consider one: he worries a truce would leave Hamas in power.

Instead, American officials are pushing to expand humanitarian support and work out what comes next in Gaza. They have unsuccessfully urged Egypt to take in refugees. Now they are struggling to persuade Israel and Arab countries to commit to the creation of a [post-war peacekeeping force](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2023/11/13/the-aftermath-of-the-war-with-israel-will-shape-palestinian-life) for the enclave. Meanwhile, America hopes that Israel will let the Palestinian Authority resume control of Gaza, an idea on which Binyamin Netanyahu is not keen. With the Middle East understandably focused on the present, America will struggle to make plans for a post-war future.

## Taiwan’s opposition parties join forces

Taiwan will hold presidential elections in January. A move announced this week could lead to the country relaxing its position on China. The candidates from the two main opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), will run [on the same ticket](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/15/taiwans-opposition-parties-unite). Both Hou Yu-ih of KMT and the TPP’s Ko Wen-je favour dialogue with China—and appeasing rather than resisting the government in Beijing. China, which loathes the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s candidate, William Lai, is also open to talking to them. 

To determine which candidate gets top billing, the parties will use popularity-poll rankings. The decision is due on Saturday. In late October, Mr Ko, polling at 24%, was leading Mr Hou, at 22%. Individually they both trailed Mr Lai, at 33%, but together they have a shot at beating him. Analysts caution that simple maths might be misleading, however: to some extent the two appeal to different groups of voters, who might balk at supporting the other candidate. 

## A Palestinian film festival in London

Last Saturday hundreds of thousands of protesters marched through central London demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. That backdrop will ensure bumper attendance at this year’s London Palestine Film Festival, held at the Barbican Centre since 2005. The opening night is sold out. Many Londoners are hungry to know the people behind the headlines—and what life was like for Palestinians before October 7th.

“Gaza”, a documentary, delivers just that. It stitches together photography and video of a territory often described as the world’s largest open-air prison. “Tomorrow’s Freedom”, meanwhile, follows the family of Marwan Barghouti (pictured), a senior figure in Fatah, which runs the Palestinian Authority, who has been imprisoned in Israel since 2002. The festival will run over two weeks and feature 17 events, including a book launch and what the organisers aptly call “urgent discussions”.

## Postwar art in Berlin

In September the New National Gallery in Berlin closed a long-running show that featured art from 1900 to 1945, an era that spanned the end of the German empire to the defeat of Nazism. The gallery’s new exhibit, opening on Saturday, will focus on the second half of the twentieth century—momentous years for the world in a different way. “Extreme Tension: Art between Politics and Society from 1945 to 2000” encompasses the estrangement of the cold war, when Berlin and Europe were split in two; and the optimism that followed the fall of the dividing walls. 

On display are paintings, photographs, installations and video works by 148 German and international artists. The show includes an array of artistic styles from the West and the East: abstract and figurative painting, pop art and Socialist Realism. According to the gallery’s director, the exhibit is not meant to offer answers—given the weightiness of the period’s events, how could it?—but to invite discussion.

## Weekend profile: Hemedti, the Sudanese warlord scenting victory

In theory, he was the underdog. When war broke out in Africa’s third-largest country in April, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, universally known as Hemedti, was up against the might of Sudan’s central state. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the rebellious paramilitary group under his command, had tens of thousands of well-equipped troops. But it lacked tanks and fighter jets. He had manoeuvred himself into the post of de facto vice-president in an interim government set up in 2019. Mr Dagalo hankered for the top job. But most Sudanese despised him. 

Seven months later, Mr Dagalo is winning his war against the Sudanese army. In recent weeks the RSF has chalked up several important victories in the warlord’s vast home region of Darfur in the west. Military analysts suggest it could soon try to take the rest of the country. About 6.2m Sudanese have been displaced since April alone; aid agencies say more than 6m are on the brink of famine. The UN calls it “one of the [worst humanitarian crises](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/16/the-world-is-ignoring-war-genocide-and-famine-in-sudan) in recent history”.

But Mr Dagalo has never shown much concern for the wreckage his [quest for power ](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/31/what-next-for-sudans-most-notorious-rebel-leader-known-as-hemedti)has wrought, especially against people who are not Sudanese Arab like himself. In the late 2000s, he was the most powerful militia commander in all of Darfur. His force, then known as the Janjaweed, was accused of committing genocide against the region’s African tribes on behalf of the country’s long-serving dictator, Omar al-Bashir.

In the following decade, Mr Dagalo built a sprawling transnational business empire specialising in mercenaries and gold mining. The Janjaweed was formalised as the RSF, and Mr Dagalo became Mr Bashir’s most trusted lieutenant. (The ousted dictator called him Hamayti, meaning “my protector”.) But in 2019 he turned on his patron, siding with pro-democracy demonstrators and engineering a coup which [thrust him into office](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/15/a-general-a-warlord-and-an-economist-vie-to-run-sudan). Two years later, he took part in a [second putsch](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/sudans-democratic-transition-is-upended-by-a-second-coup-in-two-years/21805857), this time siding with the army to oust civilians from the power-sharing government that was set up after the fall of Mr Bashir. 

Now Mr Dagalo claims—implausibly—that he is fighting against the generals in order to restore democracy. But conflict monitors warn of more [genocidal violence](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/05/genocide-returns-to-darfur) should his forces prevail. Victory within grasp, he shows little interest in talks. Outsiders, distracted by events elsewhere in the world, display equally little appetite to halt his murderous march.
