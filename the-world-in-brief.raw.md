The <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> [raised interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/26/americas-battle-with-inflation-is-about-to-get-trickier) by a quarter-point, taking its benchmark rate to a range between 5.25% and 5.5%. Jerome Powell, chair of America’s central bank, declined to predict the pace of future rate increases and said that would depend on forthcoming data. To policymakers’ relief, America’s inflation rate appears to be easing—it was 3% in June, down by six percentage points from a year ago.

## The ECB’s out-of-office meeting

The governing council of the European Central Bank (ECB) must be itching to go on holiday after months of difficult [interest-rate decisions](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/05/economists-draw-swords-over-how-to-fix-inflation). But before they set their email auto-replies, the ECB faces a final call on Thursday. Rates might go up by another quarter of a percentage point. But the council’s more doveish members may prefer to hold off until they regroup in a few weeks. 

Price rises in the euro zone have slowed: both headline and core inflation (which strips out energy and food prices) stood at 5.5% in June. But the private-sector economy is weakening and business sentiment is sagging, especially in Germany. If monetary policy is indeed working to cool both inflation and growth, the ECB could be close to pausing rate hikes, as other central banks have done. But the available [data may not yet support](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/05/economists-draw-swords-over-how-to-fix-inflation) a change of direction. Do not email in the meantime: the central bankers are out of the office, but will be back with a re-assessment in September.

## African leaders go to Russia with less love

The Russia-Africa Summit which starts on Thursday in St Petersburg was meant to be a diplomatic victory for Vladimir Putin. Since Russia’s president began his full-scale invasion of Ukraine the Kremlin has redoubled its efforts to [woo African states](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/26/russia-and-ukraine-are-battling-for-influence-in-africa), not least for their political influence: the continent’s 54 countries hold more than a quarter of votes at the UN General Assembly.

But the reported turnout—17 leaders versus 43 at the previous meeting in 2019—shows the limits of Russia’s appeal. A few attendees are [customers of the Wagner Group](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/06/27/what-next-for-wagners-african-empire) of mercenaries; others want Russian arms. Some see Mr Putin as an ally in promoting a more multilateral world. But African countries are generally pragmatic. Russia has less [economic clout](https://www.economist.com/interactive/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/18/why-africa-is-poised-to-become-a-big-player-in-energy-markets) than America, China or the EU. And its recent withdrawal from a deal to release Ukrainian grain exports will have harmed African interests. As a result many of the continent’s leaders may have decided that attending would have offered Russia a public-relations win too cheaply.

## Party in the DPRK

North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, is having a party—and, for the first time in years, he has invited guests. On Thursday Chinese and Russian delegations will watch a military parade that celebrates “Victory Day”—the 70th anniversary of the day North Korea claims, controversially, to have won the Korean war. No one else is known to have entered the country since it closed its borders at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, apart from a new Chinese ambassador who arrived with his staff in March and an [American soldier](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/07/19/an-american-soldier-has-deserted-to-north-korea) who dashed across the border last week.

Don’t expect a grand reopening [soon](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/07/24/kim-jong-un-has-no-desire-to-let-his-country-rejoin-the-world). The pandemic allowed Mr Kim to exert even tighter control over his heavily policed fief, and to continue [developing nuclear weapons](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many). As he has China’s and Russia’s support, chidings from America or South Korea have little sting. Mr Kim is having far too good a time to let his revelries end.

## Meloni cosies up in Washington

Italy’s prime minister, [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-allies-take-power-in-italy), meets President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday amid signs she is ready to pull her country out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In 2019 Giuseppe Conte’s populist coalition [signed up](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/03/21/italys-plan-to-join-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-ruffles-feathers) to the programme of infrastructure projects that spans Eurasia, the Middle East and Africa. The pact has been one of the few bones of contention between America and its ally. It is due for renewal by the end of this year. 

Ms Meloni has won friends in America by [supporting Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/05/18/for-giorgia-meloni-supporting-ukraine-has-some-useful-benefits) both diplomatically and militarily, despite being yoked in government to two parties, the Northern League and Forza Italia, once closely linked to Russia. Since becoming prime minister, she has also dropped her fiery Eurosceptic rhetoric. That too is appreciated in Washington. But Mr Biden is politically distant from the hard-right Ms Meloni and has been reluctant to invite her to the table with other European allies. Ditching the BRI could bring her [closer to the in-crowd](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/23/joe-biden-will-embrace-allies-and-enlist-them-to-take-on-china).

## And now for something completely different…

In “Different Times: a History of British Comedy”, David Stubbs, a culture writer, charts the country’s [changing sense of humour](https://www.economist.com/international/2019/05/18/the-boundaries-between-politics-and-stand-up-comedy-are-crumbling). Post-war comedy, he argues, was disinterested in altering the status quo—although that is news to anyone who has watched Monty Python. But he observes that from the late 1970s comedy merged with activism: stand-ups such as Alexei Sayle and Ben Elton fought Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative governments armed with gags. A decade of foul-mouthed shows followed, which were filled with righteous anger. Then comedy entered a new phase: political correctness.

Mr Stubbs sees this not as a straitjacket for comedians but as a liberation. He says that scrapping offensive tropes such as “dolly birds, amiable sex pests, comical Asians [and] nancy boys” enabled comedians to explore a broader sweep of British life. It is indeed good that comedians are no longer “punching down”—but comedy thrives on transgression. If comedians become too nice they might stop punching at all.
